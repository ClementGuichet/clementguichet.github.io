**Research project:**

Cognitive neuroscience is undergoing a paradigm shift. The abundance of multimodal empirical data, coupled with the unprecendented computational capabilities, is helping to redefine the links between the brain and human behavior. The brain is now understood as a vast network of interactions between cerebral regions from which cognitive operations and processes emerge. Specifically, \*\*language functions (L)\*\* are not isolated but constantly interact with \*\*declarative memory (M)\*\* and \*\*executive functions (EF)\*\*. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this \*\*L-M-EF dynamic\*\* remain unclear. The \*\*cognitomic perspective\*\* (structure-function-cognition) is closely linked to the identification of multimodal L-M-EF phenotypes, that is the neuropsychological implications that the language connectomic architecture places on cognition.

Thus, this project has a theoretical dimension, through the enrichment of a neurocognitive L-M-EF model, and a methodological dimension, through the fusion of multimodal data required to evaluate this model (i.e. structural, functional, cognitive-behavioral). In fine, we expect this project to enable significant advances in both fundamental and clinical research (e.g. pre-habilitation & cognitive rehabilitation).

In our latest preprint [@guichet2023], we modeled the neural mechanisms that uphold inter-cognitive functioning across the lifespan. The SENECA model has three dimensions:

-   At the [**cognitive level (CA)**]{.underline}, we show that language is not isolated but works in synergy with LTM and EF across the lifespan

-   At the [**cerebral level (SE)**]{.underline}, we show that DMN-FPN coupling is essential to mitigate cognitive decline, achieving an optimal balance between the cost of reorganization of neural connections and the cognitive efficiency.

-   Taken together [**(SE-NE-CA)**]{.underline}, less DMN-FPN coupling may be responsible for a transition around 50yo towards less synergistic processing, accelerating cognitive decline in highly synergistic tasks such as lexical production.

#### What's next?

We are now investigating the structural underpinnings of the DMN-FPN coupling across the lifespan and whether SC-FC coupling can be a reliable biomarker of individuals with high vs. low cognitive reserve, thus predicting healthy cognitive aging.

SENECA provides new insights on neural mechanisms that\nuphold the inter-cognitive functioning during healthy aging.\n# Abstract {#abstract .unnumbered}\nHealthy aging is associated with a heterogeneous decline across\ncognitive functions, typically observed in language performances.\nExamining resting-state fMRI and neuropsychological data from 628\nhealthy adults (age 18-88) from the CamCAN cohort, we performed\nstate-of-the-art graph theoretical analysis to uncover the neural\nmechanisms underlying this cognitive variability. At the cognitive\nlevel, our findings suggest that language processing is not an isolated\nfunction but is modulated throughout an individual’s lifespan by the\nextent of inter-cognitive synergy between language, long-term memory,\nand executive functions. At the cerebral level, we show that the\ncoupling between DMN (Default Mode Network) and FPN (Fronto-Parietal\nNetwork) regions may be the way for the brain to compensate for the\neffects of dedifferentiation at a minimal cost, efficiently mitigating\nthe age-related cognitive decline in language production, fluid\nprocessing, and verbal fluency. Notably, the dynamic of cognitive\nresilience provided by this synergistic coupling seems to follow the\nSeneca effect typically found in complex systems: a slow rise followed\nby an abrupt decline. Specifically, we argue that reducing the DMN-FPN\ncoupling could trigger accelerated cognitive decline around age 50. We\nsummarize our findings in a novel SENECA model (Synergistic, Economical,\nNonlinear, Emergent, Cognitive Aging), integrating connectomic and\ncognitive perspectives within a complex system perspective. Our study\nfurthers our understanding of the dedifferentiation-compensation\nmechanisms that uphold inter-cognitive functioning during healthy aging\nand suggests that the fifth decade of life could transition towards less\nsynergistic processing.\n**Keywords:** language, healthy aging, synergy, functional\nreorganization, graph theory\n# Introduction\nThe crucial need to comprehend the mechanisms that uphold normal\ncognitive functioning during aging arises from the significant increase\nin the proportion of older individuals (Antoniou & Wright, 2017). A\ngradual decline in cognitive abilities typically accompanies aging.\nHowever, this decline is heterogeneous across cognitive functions, and\nsome of them, such as language, semantic memory, and vocabulary, tend to\nbe preserved longer (Harada et al., 2013). Therefore, this study aims to\nshed light on the neural mechanisms that underpin this variability,\njointly exploring the functional brain architecture and cognitive\nperformance. Specifically, we hypothesize that changes in language\nfunction across the lifespan are subserved by the reconfiguration of the\nlanguage neurocognitive architecture within the framework of an\ninter-cognitive interaction between language, long-term memory, and\nexecutive functions.\nFrom a cognitive standpoint, language decline under the effect of age is\nnot uniform (Baciu et al., 2021). Although overall language performances\ntend to be preserved, certain linguistic operations may be impaired with\nage (Ramscar et al., 2014; Wlotko et al., 2010). Indeed, while language\ncomprehension demonstrates higher resilience to the effects of aging\n(Diaz et al., 2016; Rossi & Diaz, 2016), language production, which\ninvolves word retrieval and generation (Baciu et al., 2016, 2021), tends\nto be more significantly impaired with age (Evrard, 2002; Ramscar et\nal., 2014). This is evident in tip-of-the-tongue situations, where\nindividuals experience a feeling of knowing the meaning of a word but\nstruggle to immediately recall and produce the word form (Burke et al.,\n1991; Condret-Santi et al., 2013). This discrepancy between\ncomprehension and production can be attributed to the advantages of\nsemantic context and the accumulation of verbal knowledge throughout the\nlifespan (Deary et al., 2009).\nFrom a cerebral standpoint, brain networks may interact with one\nanother, reflecting how language adapts to socio-communicative contexts\nby drawing memories, knowledge, and beliefs from long-term memory (Duff\n& Brown-Schmidt, 2012; Horton, 2007) under the control of executive\nfunctions (Corballis, 2019; Hertrich et al., 2020). While long-term\nmemory provides ‘traffic’ content and coherency, executive functioning\nprovides flexibility and coordination to focus, plan, accomplish tasks,\nand control emotions. In a previous teamwork (Roger, Banjac, et al.,\n2022), our team proposed a theoretical framework that conceptualizes the\ninter-cognitive synergy between language, long-term memory, and\nexecutive functions at the cognitive level, L∪M (i.e.,\nLanguage/union/Memory), and suggested that functional connectivity-based\ninteractions may implement this synergy at the neural level.\nIndeed, based on a data-driven approach, the language neurocognitive\narchitecture based on extrinsic brain activity (Roger, Rodrigues De\nAlmeida, et al., 2022) has been highlighted as a language connectome\ncomprising four non-overlapping subsystems, each probabilistically\nmapping onto known resting-state brain networks (i.e., RSNs; Ji et al.,\n2019): core Language (Net1), Control-Executive (Net2), Conceptual\n(Net3), and Sensorimotor (Net4). Interestingly, these findings indicate\nthat age-related decline in language production impacts the\nextra-linguistic components (Net2 and Net3) beyond the typical core\nlanguage network (Hertrich et al., 2020). This suggests that language\nperformances in older adults could be determined by synergistic\nprocessing (Gatica et al., 2021) or higher-order connectivity-based\ninteractions between regions that support control-executive and\nconceptual processes. In light of the effect that the reconfiguration of\nthe language connectome has on language function, our team also proposed\nadopting a ‘cognitomic’ perspective (Roger et al., 2018), which\nemphasizes the neuropsychological implications that this connectomic\narchitecture has across the lifespan.\nWithin this cognitomic perspective, graph theory (Bullmore & Sporns,\n2009; Bullmore & Bassett, 2011; Rubinov & Sporns, 2010) is appropriate\nto identify the neural substrates of this inter-cognitive synergy.\nSpecifically, the brain network can be characterized in terms of\nintegration and segregation properties (Cohen & D’Esposito, 2016; Genon\net al., 2018) at different topological levels (i.e.,\nwhole-brain/system-level, modular/subsystem-level, and\nregion/nodal-level) (Farahani et al., 2019; Fornito et al., 2016).\nAcross the lifespan, cognitive efficiency is supported by a balance\nbetween integrated and modular information processing (Bullmore &\nSporns, 2012; Meunier et al., 2010; van den Heuvel & Sporns, 2013). In\nother words, optimal coordination of neural activity is based on the\nhomeostasis between integration and segregation properties (Cole et al.,\n2013; Fornito et al., 2015).\nIn line with our previous findings (Roger, Rodrigues De Almeida, et al.,\n2022), a recent systematic review of resting-state data studies reported\nthat reduced local efficiency at the system level, along with reduced\nsegregation and enhanced integration within and between RSNs at the\nsubsystem level, are the connectomic fingerprints of healthy aging with\nan inflection point around the fifth decade of life (Deery et al.,\n2023). However, a crucial challenge resides in understanding the\nmechanisms that bridge reduced segregation with enhanced integration\n(Stumme et al., 2020) and how these changes induce a dynamic at the\nsystem level associated with cognitive performance as age advances.\nIndeed, studies report contradictory findings depending on the\ntopological level of analysis. At the system level, age-related enhanced\nintegration (Battaglia et al., 2020) is generally associated with a\ndedifferentiated system that fails to alternate efficiently between\nintegrative and segregative states of connectivity (Chan et al., 2014;\nChan et al., 2017). At a subsystem level, brain regions undergo a\nsimilar dedifferentiation process associated with a loss in function\nspecialization (Goh et al., 2010; Park et al., 2004). This is primarily\nreflected by reduced segregation and enhanced integration in the\nsensorimotor and higher-order executive networks (Deery et al., 2023;\nWig, 2017). However, in contrast with the system level, enhanced\nintegration has been shown to be compensatory (Cabeza et al., 2018) with\ndirect benefits on preserving cognitive performances (Bertolero et al.,\n2015; Meunier et al., 2010). Specifically, increased coupling between\nDMN and control-executive regions across subnetworks has also been\nlinked with better global cognitive performances (Spreng et al., 2018;\nSpreng & Turner, 2019). Specifically, it appears that the deactivation\nof DMN regions may be a key ingredient of cognitive resilience across\nthe lifespan or the capacity to mitigate the deleterious effect of\ndedifferentiation (Deery et al., 2023; Grady et al., 2016; Singh-Manoux\net al., 2012; Varangis et al., 2019). Indeed, failing to deactivate the\nDMN subnetwork seems to worsen performance in synergistic cognitive\nfunctions, based on intra-linguistic and control-executive processes,\nsuch as verbal fluency (Muller et al., 2016; Whiteside et al., 2016).\nOverall, the main objective of this study is to investigate how the\nreorganization of the language connectome relates to the variability of\ncognitive performances across the lifespan. By assuming that language is\na complex function in synergy with long-term memory and executive\nfunctions, we aimed to model how changes in the neural mechanisms that\nsupport this inter-cognitive synergy underlie this variability. To\naddress this objective, we leveraged a population-based resting state\nfMRI dataset from the CamCAN cohort (Cam-CAN et al., 2014) and applied\ngraph theoretical analyses to evaluate the reorganization of the\nlanguage connectome in terms of segregation and integration properties\nat multiple topological scales of analysis.\n# Materials & Methods\n## Participants\nWe included 652 healthy adults from the Cambridge Center for Ageing and\nNeuroscience project cohort (Cam-CAN et al., 2014). Further recruitment\ninformation can be found in Taylor et al. (2017). Our analysis focused\nexclusively on functional fMRI brain data obtained during a resting\nstate period. After careful examination, we had a final sample size of\n628 participants (age range: 18-88; 320 females; 208 males). Several\nparticipants were excluded from the analysis for various reasons,\nincluding missing functional imaging data (N = 4), incomplete volume\nacquisition (N = 4; one subject was retained with 74% of the total\nnumber of volumes), unreliable CSF mask (N = 9), and having 10% or more\noutlying volumes after preprocessing (M = 13.6, SD = 3.2, N = 8). Then,\nwe chose eight cognitive tasks to span a continuous spectrum from a high\nto a low degree of synergy between language, long-term memory, and\nexecutive functions (Table 1). Consequently, the dataset was further\nreduced to 613 participants to analyze the relationship between brain\nactivity and cognition. Specifically, we excluded participants with more\nthan 3 missing neuropsychological scores and replaced the latter with\nthe appropriate median of the age decile for the remaining participants.\n+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| Cognitive Task | Processes involved |\n| | |\n| | (from high to low amount of |\n| | inter-cognitive synergy) |\n+=========================+============================================+\n| Verbal Fluency | Language (phonological, semantic) & |\n| | Executive function (EF) |\n| (Lezak et al., 2012) | |\n+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| Hotel task | EF (planning & multitasking) |\n| | |\n| (Shallice & Burgess, | |\n| 1991) | |\n+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| Proverb comprehension | EF (abstraction) & Language |\n| | (comprehension) |\n| (Huppert et al., 1994) | |\n+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| Naming | Language (phonological access & semantic |\n| | memory) |\n| (Clarke et al., 2013) | |\n+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| Tip-of-the-tongue | Language (retrieval) & EF (error |\n| | monitoring) |\n| (Brown & McNeill, 1966) | |\n+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| Cattell task | EF (Fluid intelligence) |\n| | |\n| (Cattell & Cattell, | |\n| 1960) | |\n+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| Story recall | Long-term memory |\n| | |\n| (Tulsky et al., 2003) | |\n+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| Sentence comprehension | Language (syntactic, semantic) |\n| | |\n| (Rodd et al., 2010) | |\n+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n**Table 1**. Presentation of the eight cognitive tasks considered in\nthis study. A detailed description of the tasks can be found in Table\nS1, Appendix S2\n## MR acquisition\nFor information regarding the MR acquisition and the resting state\nprotocol applied in this study, please refer to Cam-CAN et al. (2014),\nas the data was sourced from the Cambridge Center for Ageing and\nNeuroscience project cohort.\n## Resting-state fMRI data analysis\n### Data Preprocessing\nThe rs-fMRI data underwent preprocessing using SPM12 (Welcome Department\nof Imaging Neuroscience, UK, &lt;http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/&gt;) within\nMATLAB R2020b (MathWorks Inc., Sherborn, MA, USA). We employed a\nstandard preprocessing pipeline (including realignment, reslicing,\nco-registration, segmentation, normalization, and smoothing) similar to\nthat described in our previous work (see Roger et al., 2020) with\nspecific details mentioned in Appendix S1.\n### Cerebral parcellation: the LANG connectome atlas\nThe LANG connectome atlas, referred to as the LANG atlas, comprises a\ncollection of 131 regions of interest (ROI) derived from a panel of 13\nlanguage fMRI tasks (see Roger, Rodrigues De Almeida, et al., 2022).\nEach ROI is represented by a spherical region with a diameter of 6 mm,\ncentered on the MNI coordinates as proposed by Power et al. (2011). To\ntransform the LANG atlas, which is based on extrinsic fMRI activation,\ninto a resting-state LANG (rs-LANG) atlas consisting of ROIs derived\nfrom the intrinsic activity, we labeled all LANG regions according to\ntheir primary resting-state network (RSN) based on the Cole-Anticevic\nBrainwide Net Partition (CAB-NP; Ji et al., 2019). We utilized a\npublicly available volumetric version of the CAB-NP that was converted\nto standard MNI space. By overlaying the volumetric RSN map onto the 131\nregions (see Banjac et al., 2021), we determined the number of voxels\nthat overlapped between each region and each RSN. This approach ensured\naccurate voxel-based labeling of each region to their primary RSN.\nDuring the examination of the modular organization of rs-LANG (see\nFigure 2), the RSN composition of a given subsystem was weighted by the\nmean percentage of overlap between the primary RSN and each region of\nthe identified subsystem. This improvement led to a 12% increase in mean\naccuracy.\n### Resting-state LANG connectomes\nUsing the CONN toolbox (Behzadi et al., 2007), we conducted an\nROI-to-ROI analysis and generated a connectivity matrix of dimensions\n131x131 for each participant. These connectivity matrices were\nsubsequently employed for network analysis. We disregarded negative\ncorrelations by setting them to zero, consistent with previous studies\n(Chong et al., 2019; Martin et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2011).\nAdditionally, we applied thresholding to each matrix at five sparsity\nlevels (10, 12, 15, 17, and 20%). This step aimed to reduce the presence\nof spurious connections and was based on the most likely sparsity levels\nknown to produce a small-world organization, as outlined by Achard and\nBullmore (2007). Subsequently, the thresholded matrices were binarized\nto generate five undirected graphs for each participant.\n## Resting state LANG network analysis\nThe network analysis, or graph analysis, was employed to measure\ninformation flow within each connectome (Rubinov & Sporns, 2010).\nSpecifically, we assessed (i) the balance between functional integration\nand segregation at the system level, (ii) the modularity at the\nsubsystem level, and (iii) the information transfer at the nodal level\nby evaluating the topological role of each region.\n### System-level analysis: integration vs. segregation balance assessment\nUsing the Brain Connectivity Toolbox (BCT) implemented in MATLAB 2020b\nand available at &lt;https://www.nitrc.org/projects/bct/&gt; (Bullmore &\nSporns, 2009), we extracted three key graph metrics: (1) global\nefficiency (Eglob), (2) local efficiency (Eloc), and (3) clustering\ncoefficient (Clustcoeff). Globally, Eglob was calculated as the inverse\nof the shortest path lengths or the average of unweighted efficiencies\nacross all pairs of nodes (Latora & Marchiori, 2001). This metric\nquantifies the efficiency of parallel information transmission across\nthe global network (Bullmore & Bassett, 2011). Locally, Eloc is similar\nto Eglob but on node neighborhoods. When averaged at the system level,\nit illustrates the segregation property of a network for processing\ninformation (Latora & Marchiori, 2001). For each node, the clustering\ncoefficient (Clustcoeff) was calculated as the fraction of a node’s\nneighbors that are also neighbors of each other (Rubinov & Sporns, 2010)\nand averaged at the system level. We visually inspected Eglob and\nClustcoeff across the five sparsity levels and determined that the\noptimal threshold that balances integrated and modular processing was\n15% (Figure S2, Appendix S2). We further ensured that this threshold was\noptimal by repeating the procedure for each age decile. Following this,\nwe reduced all graphs to a fixed number of edges by retaining the top\n15% (2554 edges). Additionally, we verified that the reduced connectomes\nmaintained full connectivity and sufficiently devoided of isolated\nnodes, meaning that the largest connected component (LCC) included at\nleast 80% of all nodes. After thresholding at 15%, we characterized the\nbalance between functional integration and segregation at the system\nlevel by determining the relative predominance of global (Eglob) versus\nlocal efficiency (Eloc). A higher balance reflects a higher predominance\nof integration or higher integrative/global efficiency.\n$$System - level\\ balance\\ (integration\\ vs.\\ segregation)\\ = \\frac{E_{glob}{- \\ E}_{loc}}{E_{glob} + E_{loc}}$$\n### Subsystem-level analysis: modularity assessment\nTo examine the modular organization of rs-LANG, we employed the Louvain\ncommunity detection algorithm (Blondel et al., 2008) with a resolution\nparameter set to γ = 1.295, aiming to align with the RSNs identified in\nthe CAB-NP Atlas (Ji et al., 2019). As different runs of the algorithm\ncan yield varying optimal partitions, we implemented a consensus\nclustering approach (Lancichinetti & Fortunato, 2012). This approach\ninvolves iteratively clustering co-assignment matrices until\nconvergence, aggregating the frequency of node assignments to the same\nmodule. To reduce spurious node assignments, we applied a threshold of τ\n= 0.5 to the co-assignment matrices (Jiang et al., 2021). If a node did\nnot consistently belong to the same module in at least 50% of the\niterations, its co-assignment weight was set to zero. We executed the\nalgorithm 1000 times for each subject and repeated the entire process\n1000 times to generate a group-level consensus partition based on the\nsubject-level partitions. We ensured that this consensus partition\naccurately represented all individuals across different ages, confirming\nits suitability for statistical analysis (refer to Appendix S1 for\nfurther information).\n### Nodal-level analysis: topological roles\nAt the nodal level, we investigated the topological reorganization of\neach connectome by defining four distinct topological roles: Connector,\nProvincial, Satellite, and Peripheral (Bertolero et al., 2015; Guimerà &\nAmaral, 2005). Therefore, the composition of each individual’s language\nconnectome is represented by four percentages which add up to 100%. To\nassign each role to a node (i.e., a region), we employed two graph\nmetrics, (i) the Within-Module Z-score (WMZ; Latora & Marchiori, 2001),\nwhich quantifies connectivity within subsystems (intra-modular), and\n(ii) the normalized Participation Coefficient (PC; Pedersen et al.,\n2019) which measures connectivity between subsystems (inter-modular)\nwhile removing the bias associated with the number of nodes in each\nmodule. Consistent with prior research (Roger, Rodrigues De Almeida, et\nal., 2022; Schedlbauer & Ekstrom, 2019), we standardized both metrics\n(WMZ and zPCnorm) for each individual and assigned a topological role to\neach node. In relation to the entire set of 131 regions, a Connector\nnode displays a high proportion of both intra- and inter-modular\nconnections (zPCnorm \\&gt;= 0, WMZ \\&gt;= 1e-5). A Provincial node displays a\nhigh proportion of intra-modular connections (zPCnorm \\&lt; 0, WMD \\&gt;=\n1e-5). A Satellite node displays a high proportion of inter-modular\nconnections (zPCnorm \\&gt;= 0, WMZ \\&lt; 1e-5). A Peripheral node, on the\nother hand, displays a low proportion of all modular connections\n(zPCnorm \\&lt; 0, WMZ \\&lt; 1e-5).\n## Statistics\nWe conducted statistical analysis along four steps. Figure 1 illustrates\nthe analytical pipeline. First, we examined the evolution in the\nproportion of topological roles across the lifespan using compositional\nanalysis techniques (Greenacre, 2021). Second, we modeled the neural\nmechanisms that drive this evolution using probabilities. This allowed\nus to uncover the patterns and principles governing the connectivity\nchanges in the language connectome across the lifespan. Third, we\nemployed a canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to examine the\nmany-to-many relationships between these neural mechanisms and the\nchanges in cognitive performances across the lifespan. Finally, CCA\nanalysis helped specify a causal model of how changes in the topological\nproperties of the language connectome, at the system and subsystem\nlevels, may explain the variability in age-related cognitive\nperformances.\n![](media/image2.png){width=“6.613888888888889in”\nheight=“2.6372812773403322in”}\n**Figure 1.** Illustration of the analysis pipeline\n### Compositional analysis of the language connectome\nDue to the high correlation among components and the dependence on\npairwise covariance (Greenacre, 2021; Smith et al., 2016), the relative\ncount of topological roles was unsuitable for direct statistical\nanalysis. To address this issue, we used a log-based transformation that\nmapped these counts to Euclidean space (i.e., isometric log-ratios\n(ilr); Egozcue, 2003) (refer to Appendix S1 for more details). This\ntransformation allowed us to construct four log-contrasts, referred to\nas compositional balances in our study, to capture the dynamics of each\nrole across the lifespan, specifically Connector, Provincial,\nPeripheral, and Satellite (Eq. 1). To enhance the interpretability of\nthese log-contrasts and address potential issues regarding causality\n(Ailer et al., 2021), we incorporated the count of all topological roles\ninto the equation. This ensured that an increase in the Connector\nbalance was necessarily driven by an increase in the absolute count of\nconnector nodes. Hereafter Eq.1 describes the compositional balances.\n$$\\mathbf{Connector\\ balance = \\ }\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}}\\ \\ln\\left( \\frac{Connector}{(Provincial \\times Peripheral \\times Satellite)^{\\frac{1}{3}}} \\right)$$\n$${\\mathbf{Provincial}\\ \\mathbf{balance} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}}\\ \\ln\\left( \\frac{Provincial}{(Connector \\times Peripheral \\times Satellite)^{\\frac{1}{3}}} \\right)\n}{\\mathbf{Peripheral\\ balance}\\ = \\ \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}}\\ \\ln\\left( \\frac{Peripheral}{(Connector \\times Provincial \\times Satellite)^{\\frac{1}{3}}} \\right)}$$\n$$\\mathbf{Satellite\\ balance}\\ = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}}\\ \\ln\\left( \\frac{Satellite}{(Connector \\times Provincial \\times Peripheral)^{\\frac{1}{3}}} \\right)$$\nSubsequently, for each compositional balance, we used generalized\nadditive models (GAM) with factor-smooth interactions to track the\nevolution in the proportion of each topological role across the lifespan\nwithin each subsystem of the resting-state language connectome (rs-LANG)\n(Wood, 2006); mgcv package in R, Wood, 2017). For additional information\nand specifics, please refer to Appendix S1.\n### Probabilistic analysis of the neural mechanisms\nTo elucidate the neural mechanisms driving the evolution of the\nproportion of topological roles (section 2.5.1), we modeled the\nprobability that each region changes its topological role across the\nlifespan. Based on the compositional results (section 3.2), we\ndetermined the most probable role of each region within three distinct\nage groups: a younger group (18-45 excluded), a middle-aged group (45-55\nincluded), and an older group (\\&gt;55). Concretely, we first calculated\nthe probabilities for all pairwise trajectories between the younger and\nmiddle-aged groups and then repeated the calculation between the\nresulting non-zero trajectories and the older age group. To account for\nthe inter-individual variability within each age group, we considered\nall the trajectories whose probability fell within a 5% range from the\nhighest probability for each region. Using this approach, we captured\nfor each region the most likely transitions of topological roles between\nage groups while considering the variability within each age group.\n### Canonical correlation analysis\nTo identify the many-to-many relationships between subsystem-level\nbalances (brain set) and neuropsychological scores (cognitive set), we\nconducted a canonical correlation analysis (CCA). CCA works by finding\nthe linear combinations within the brain and cognitive set of variables\nthat maximize the correlation between the two sets (Wang et al., 2020).\nThe analysis produces a number of canonical functions equal to the\nnumber of variables within the smaller set (viz., eight functions for\nthe eight variables of the cognitive set). Each canonical function is\ncomposed of two variates: a latent brain and cognitive variable (Sherry\n& Henson, 2005). To address the issue of multicollinearity among brain\nvariables inherent to compositional data, we ran two CCA models: one\nexcluding the Satellite balances and the other excluding the Peripheral\nbalances of each subsystem. Both CCA models yielded identical structure\ncoefficients ($r_{s}$), representing the correlations between the\nobserved variables and the variates and identical latent coordinates for\nthe variates, although with different linear combinations (*b;* function\ncoefficients). This approach allowed us to construct a latent\ncorrelational space based on the cognitive variate-cognitive variable\nand cognitive variate-brain variable correlations.\n### Causal analysis\nBased on the results from the CCA analysis, we proposed a causal model\nthat integrates age (X), cognitive performance (Y), subsystem\nreconfiguration of the resting-state language connectome, as measured by\nthe compositional balances (M), and the balance between integration and\nsegregation properties at the system level (W). Using the lavaan package\nin R (Rosseel, 2012), we examined how a higher integrative efficiency\n(W) may mitigate cognitive decline by reducing the mediation effect (X\n-\\&gt; M -\\&gt; Y). To achieve this, we tested for indirect path moderation\nusing an index of moderated mediation and a simple slope analysis should\nthe index be significant (Hayes, 2018). For more details, please refer\nto Appendix S1.\n# Results\n## Modular organization of the Language connectome at rest (rs-LANG)\nApplying modularity analysis to the resting-state Language connectome\n(rs-LANG) uncovered four main subsystems. Figure 2 provides a visual\nrepresentation of these subsystems. Appendix S2 provides a detailed\ncomparison with the task-based modular organization of the same\nconnectome, described by Roger, Rodrigues De Almeida, et al. (2022).\nConsidering the composition, the largest subsystem, RS NET1 (40\nregions), is composed of 66.4% of DMN regions known to be involved in\nhigher-level cognitive function and can thus be regarded as the\nassociative subsystem. The second largest subsystem, RS NET2 (34\nregions), is saturated by sensorimotor regions (SMN; 77.1%) along with\ncontributions from CON regions (15.3%) and can thus be regarded as the\nsensorimotor subsystem. The third largest subsystem, RS NET3 (32\nregions), engages the cingulo-opercular network (CON; 56.4%), a broader\nnetwork encompassing the salience network (SAL) and known to support\nlow-level attentional redirection. It can thus be regarded as the\nlow-level attentional subsystem. The smallest subsystem, RS NET4 (22\nregions), is saturated by FPN regions (63.1%), with nontrivial\ncontributions from CON regions as well (17.2%), and can thus be regarded\nas the control-executive subsystem. In addition, RS NET1 & 3 are\nsupported by FPN regions (13.8% & 11.8%), and RS NET1, 3, and 4 by\nLanguage regions (13%, 10.8%, 8.6%).\n![](media/image3.emf){width=“4.1382392825896765in”\nheight=“4.693222878390201in”}\n**Figure** **2**.

Only the left\nhemisphere (LH) is represented here (see Figure S1, Appendix S2 for a\nwhole-brain projection). An additional 3-region module (black)\nassociated with the VMM network has been identified but not considered\nfor analysis due to its instability as a stand-alone module across the\nlifespan. Brain visualization created with the package *ggseg* in R\n(Mowinckel & Vidal-Piñeiro, 2020)\n## Compositional analysis of the language connectome\nOverall, we found that healthy aging is associated with reduced local\nefficiency (*t* = -10.37, p \\&lt; .001, $\\eta_{2p}$ = .15, 95% CI \\[.11;\nInf\\]) and preserved global efficiency (*t* = -1.14, p = .26), which\ntilts the balance between integration and segregation towards a higher\nintegrative efficiency as age increases (*t* = 9.71, p \\&lt; .001,\n$\\eta_{2p}$ = .13, 95% CI \\[.09; Inf\\]) (see Figure 3A).\nConsidering the evolution of topological roles (Figure 3B), we found\nthat healthy aging is associated with a decrease in the proportion of\nprovincial nodes (*b* = -0.07 95% CI \\[-0.09; -0.05\\]; F(1, 624) = 52.5;\np \\&lt; .001; $\\eta_{p}^{2}$ = .08) and satellite nodes (*b* = -0.03 95% CI\n\\[-0.04; -0.01\\]; F(1, 624) = 20.3; p \\&lt; .001; $\\eta_{p}^{2}$ = .03),\nwhich is contrasted by an increase in the proportion of connector nodes\n(*b* = 0.04 95% CI \\[0.02; 0.05\\]; F(1, 624) = 31.5; p \\&lt; .001;\n$\\eta_{p}^{2}$ = .05) and peripheral nodes (*b* = 0.04 95% CI \\[0.02;\n0.05\\]; F(1, 624) = 25.6; p \\&lt; .001; $\\eta_{p}^{2}$ = .04).\nConsidering the significant changes at the subsystem level (Figure 3C),\nwe found that, in RS NET4, the rate of loss of provincial nodes (F =\n29.8, p \\&lt; .001, *edf* = 1), the rate of gain of connector nodes (F =\n13.6, p \\&lt; .001, *edf* = 1) and peripheral nodes (F = 6.5, p = .02,\n*edf* = 1) remains constant across the lifespan, while the loss of\nsatellite nodes stabilizes around age 50 (F = 5.1, p = .007, *edf* =\n2.1). Interestingly, in RS NET1, we observed a dynamic of\nreconfiguration centered around this age window: while the rate of loss\nof satellite nodes remains constant (F = 15.5, p \\&lt; .001, *edf* = 1),\nthe rate of gain of peripheral nodes in RS NET1 (F = 6.7, p = .001,\n*edf* = 2.27) gets slower and the rate of gain of connector nodes tends\nto accelerate (F = 2, p = .18, *edf* = 2.37). In contrast, while the\nrate of loss of provincial nodes being quite constant (F = 6.8, p = .01,\n*edf* = 1.31), the rate of gain of connector nodes (F = 3.81, p = .034,\n*edf* = 2.23) slows down but that of peripheral nodes tends to\naccelerate (F = 1.9, p = .17, *edf* = 2.42). Overall, this suggests\nthat, around age 50, RS NET4 stops losing satellite nodes and that\nchanges in the connectivity patterns of RS NET1 and 2 are mirrored.\n![](media/image4.png){width=“6.606313429571304in”\nheight=“5.125694444444444in”}**Figure 3**.

For the subsystem level, only\nsignificant changes are illustrated.\n## Probabilistic analysis of the neural mechanisms\nProbabilistic analysis revealed that 35.8% of the language connectome\n(47 regions) undergoes a topological reorganization across the lifespan.\nAcross subsystems, 50% of RS NET4, 50% of RS NET2, and 34% of RS NET1\nregions reconfigure, whereas regions in RS NET3 are more inflexible\n(24.3%). A web app is available to explore the reconfiguration\ncross-sectionally: &lt;https://lpnc-lang.shinyapps.io/seneca/&gt;. To account\nfor inter-individual variability, we consider 16 additional\ntrajectories, which are also highly probable (see section 2.5.2 for\ndetails on the calculations), which amounts to 63 trajectories in total\nand is the number of references for the results below.\nAs suggested by compositional analysis, we found that functional\nintegration, via the gain of connector nodes, is driven by the\nreconfiguration of provincial and satellite nodes.\nConsidering provincial nodes, the decrease is mostly due to the\nacquisition of new between-subsystem connections or inter-modular links\n(i.e., provincial-to-connector; 30.1% of all reconfigurations), 52.6%\nbefore and 47.4% after age 45-55. Specifically, we notice that RS NET4,\nwhich accounts for 31.5% of these acquisitions, tends to acquire them\nbefore age 45-55 (83.3%), whereas RS NET2, which accounts for 57.8% of\nthese acquisitions, continues to acquire them after age 45-55 (63.6%).\nIn addition, we notice that the number of regions failing to acquire\nthese properties doubles across the lifespan for RS NET4 (i.e.,\nprovincial-to-satellite reconfigurations instead of\nprovincial-to-connector) and starts appearing in RS NET1. This\nhighlights the greater instability of intra-modular links after age\n45-55 in RS NET1 & 4.\nInterestingly, we observed that this dynamic correlates a change in the\nway reduced segregation is conducted across the lifespan (i.e.,\nprovincial-to-peripheral; 9.5% of all reconfigurations). Indeed, reduced\nsegregation is dominated by RS NET1 (right MTG; 92% FPN, right BA44; 72%\nDMN) and complemented by RS NET4 (left IFG; 99% FPN) before age 45-55,\nand after age 45-55 is dominated by RS NET2 (right SMA; SMN, left\nparacentral lobule; 74% DMN) and complemented by RS NET1 (left insula;\n72% DMN).\nConsidering satellite nodes, we found the opposite pattern. The decrease\nis mostly due to the acquisition of new within-subsystem connections or\nintra-modular links (i.e., satellite-to-connector; 20.6% of all\nreconfigurations), 69.2% of which occur after age 45-55. Specifically,\nRS NET3 and RS NET4, which respectively account for 38.4% and 15.3% of\nthese acquisitions, tend to acquire them after age 45-55 (80% and 100%),\nwhereas RS NET2 and 1, which respectively accounts for 30.7%, and 15.3%\nof these acquisitions, tends to acquire them in equal proportions across\nthe lifespan. In addition, we notice that this acquisition may be\ninefficient after age 45-55, given the opposite connector-to-satellite\nreconfigurations in RS NET1, 2, and 4 (8% of all reconfigurations).\nInterestingly, we observed that this dynamic correlates with a change in\nthe way deactivation is conducted across the lifespan (i.e.,\nsatellite-to-peripheral; 9.5% of all reconfigurations). Indeed, this\nmechanism occurs exclusively before age 45-55 (5 out of 6 trajectories:\n83.3%; 1 out of 6 being in RS NET4) and is most likely to be implemented\nby RS NET1 (left fusiform area; 63% DAN, 37% DMN; left paracentral\nlobule; 93% DMN; left pCC 68% DMN) as well as in bilateral postcentral\nregions in RS NET3 (95% SMN).\nTo summarize, probabilistic analysis helps us clarify the dynamic of\nreconfiguration of the language connectome across the lifespan based on\nthe reallocation of inter- and intra-modular links. As illustrated in\nFigure 4, this suggests two strategies for acquiring connector\nproperties across the lifespan: (i) an efficient, synergistic strategy\nbased on inter-modular links and the coupling between RS NET1 and RS\nNET4, which is implemented before age 45-55; (ii) an inefficient\nstrategy based on intra-modular links, which occurs primarily in older\nadults. The detail of the regions involved in all mechanisms can be\nfound in Appendix S3.\n![](media/image5.png){width=“6.588888888888889in”\nheight=“4.790943788276466in”}\n**Figure 4**. Topological model of compensatory integration. We propose\ntwo compensatory strategies to acquire connector properties across the\nlifespan: (i) a synergistic strategy based on links between subsystems\n(inter-links) and the coupling between DMN and FPN regions which is most\nefficient in younger adults. (ii) an inexpensive strategy based on links\nwithin subsystems (intra-links) which occurs primarily in older adults\n## Canonical correlation analysis\nCanonical correlation analysis (CCA) yielded two significant canonical\nfunctions, each composed of a cognitive and brain variate, which\nmaximize the correlation between the brain and cognitive set of\nvariables ($R_{c1}$ = .28; $R_{c1}²$ = 8%, p \\&lt; .001; $R_{c1}$ = .25;\n$R_{c2}²$ = 6%, p \\&lt; .001). We examine these results in two steps. In\nthe first step, we analyze the organization of the age-related\nperformances in the eight cognitive tasks based on the two cognitive\nvariates (section 3.1.1.). In the second step, we identify the brain\nvariables associated with this organization (section 3.1.2.).\n### Effect of age on cognitive functions\nBased on the correlations between the two cognitive variates and each\ncognitive variable (i.e., structure coefficients; $r_{s\\ }$), we built\nthe corresponding cognitive map shown in Figure 5A. By relating the\nage-related performances of the eight cognitive tasks (Figure 5C, Table\n2) with the cognitive map, we found that cognitive decline can be\npredicted by two factors.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nCognitive variables Goodness-of-fit of Age as a predictor (Deviance\nexplained in %)\n-------------------- --------------------------------------------------\nCattell 42.9\nNaming 41.4\nLTM 14.8\nVerbal Fluency 14.1\nTip-of-the-tongue 13\nMultitasking 8.75\nSentence 6.02\nComprehension\nProverb 3.74\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Table 2.** Estimates from generalized additive models (GAMs):\nCognitive variable **\\~** s(Age). All models are significant at p \\&lt;\n.001 ‘\\*\\*\\*’. Deviance explained is used as a proxy for the amount of\nage-related cognitive decline\nThe first factor may correspond to the amount of semantic processing\nassociated with a task. Given the high correlation between the deviance\nreported in Table 2 (r = -.94, p \\&lt; .001) and the coordinates of\ncognitive tasks on this factor, we suggest that semantic processing is\nthe main predictor of age-related cognitive performances. In other\nwords, the first factor discriminates non-semantic tasks, which tend to\ndecline the most (fluid processing: r~\\_Cattell~ = -.8; phonological\naccess: r~\\_Naming~ = -.78) from semantic tasks which tend to decline\nthe least (semantic access: r~\\_Comprehension~ = -.27; lexical\nretrieval: r~\\_ToT~ = -.26; semantic abstraction: r~\\_Proverb~ = .06).\nBased on the description of the processes recruited for each cognitive\ntask (see Table 1, section 2.1), the second factor may correspond to the\namount of synergy between language, long-term memory, and executive\nfunctions associated with a task. Interestingly, synergistic task\nperformances have a nonlinear relationship with age. Indeed, Figure 5B\nillustrates a shift around age 50 from an increase to a decrease in\nperformance (F = 5.6, p \\&lt; .001, *edf* = 2.7). Therefore, this second\nfactor may discriminate the highly synergistic tasks which follow this\nshift (r~\\_Proverb~ = -.68, r~\\_Multitasking~ = -.59,\nr~\\_Verbal_Fluency~ = -.53) from the less synergistic tasks which do not\n(r~\\_Comprehension~ = -.04, r~\\_LTM~ = -.07, and r~\\_Cattell~ = -.08).\nIn addition, this decrease in synergistic task performances is\nassociated with accelerated cognitive decline in non-semantic tasks\naround the same age window (F = 119, p \\&lt; .001, *edf* = 4.9; Figure 5B).\n![](media/image6.png){width=“6.385545713035871in”\nheight=“5.492139107611549in”}**Figure 5.** Illustration of the\npredictors of age-related cognitive performances.

These factors are calculated as the two cognitive\nvariates\\’ cross-products (i.e., diagonals). Language-related\nperformances tend to self-organize in a triangular pattern to maximize\nthe correlations with topological mechanisms (not shown here). Panel B.\nIllustrates the age-related dynamic of the cognitive map. As age\nincreases, synergistic task performances shift from better to worse\nperformances (blue). This shift is associated with an acceleration of\nthe cognitive decline in non-semantic tasks (yellow), suggesting that\nthe amount of synergy mitigates the decline in non-semantic tasks before\nage 50. Panel C. Age-related performances of the eight cognitive tasks\nusing GAMs\n### Effect of age on cognitive functions and cerebral correlates\nWe identified the brain variables that correlate with the task\nperformances of the first cognitive variate, which is the variate that\ncombines the factors identified in the previous section. As illustrated\nby the grey trajectory in Figure 5A, a high correlation with the first\ncognitive variate (e.g., r~\\_Naming~ = -.7, r~\\_Cattell~ = -.63,\nr~\\_Verbal_Fluency~ = -.62) suggests that performances tend to increase\nbefore accelerating around age 50-55. Therefore, the brain changes that\nare also highly correlated with this variate may be associated with this\ndynamic.\nBelow, we only considered the brain variables that showed a significant\nor tendency for change across the lifespan (see section 3.2). In line\nwith probabilistic analysis (section 3.3), Figure 6 illustrates that the\ndynamic of the first cognitive variate is primarily associated with\nprovincial-to-connector reconfigurations in RS NET4 and\nsatellite-to-peripheral reconfigurations in RS NET1. This further\nsuggests that a coupling between deactivation in RS NET1 and integration\nin RS NET4 is responsible for cognitive performance variations across\nthe lifespan. Moreover, Figure 6 suggests that the shift around age 50\nin the performances of synergistic tasks driven by a shift in the\nconnectivity patterns in RS NET1 from deactivation towards integration.\nThis particularly highlights the pivotal role of satellite nodes, as\npreviously identified in Figure 4 (section 3.3).\n![](media/image7.png){width=“5.500694444444444in”\nheight=“4.673611111111111in”}**Figure 6.** Neurocognitive map of healthy\naging. Coordinates represent the correlations between topological\nchanges in the language connectome and the cognitive variates (i.e.,\ncross-loadings). The shift around age 50 corresponds to a shift from\ndeactivation to integration of DMN regions which disrupts the DMN-FPN\ncoupling that mitigates cognitive decline. The black box in the bottom\nleft can be viewed in full size in Figure 5A\n## Causal analysis\nBased on the results of canonical correlation analysis, we hypothesized\nthat the synergy between deactivation in RS NET1 and integration in RS\nNET4 may mitigate cognitive decline before age 50, whereas a loss of\nthis coupling may accelerate cognitive decline after age 50. Therefore,\nwe examined whether the reorganization at the subsystem level, which we\ndescribed in the previous section, induces a high integrative efficiency\nat the system level (balance integration/segregation) to mitigate this\ndecline (see Figure S4, Appendix S2 for an illustration of the model).\nAs expected, at the subsystem level, we found that the reorganization of\nthe language connectome (i.e., less provincial nodes in RS NET4 and 2\nand more connector nodes in RS NET4 coupled with more peripheral nodes\nin RS NET1) mediates cognitive decline (mediation (a\\*b1): *z* = 3.672,\np \\&lt; .001) in non-semantic or highly synergistic tasks (r\\_~Naming~ =\n-.69, r\\_~Cattell~ = -.63, r\\_~Verbal_Fluency~ = -.62, r\\_~Multitasking~\n= -.55, r\\_~Proverb~ = -.43). Nonetheless, it seems that this\nreorganization also induces a high integrative efficiency at the system\nlevel (a\\*d1: *z* = -2.21, p = .003) which partially mitigates this\ndecline (moderated mediation (a\\*b2): *z* = -2.2, p = .03). Indeed,\nFigure 7 clarifies that a high integrative efficiency gradually\nmitigates cognitive decline until a tipping point around age 54 (Figure\n7; full tensor product: *edf* = 7.377, F = 50.1, p \\&lt; .001). line with\nour previous analyses, this could suggest a sudden loss in synergistic\nprocessing ![](media/image8.png){width=“5.7659722222222225in”\nheight=“4.162742782152231in”}between RS NET1 and RS NET4.\n**Figure 7.** Illustration of the lifespan trajectory of cognitive\nresilience provided by functional reorganization. The hyperplane shows\nwhere the most substantial impacts of moderated mediation (b2) on\ncognitive performances (Y) are. The orange arrow shows the shortest path\nto mitigate cognitive decline optimally. In the mediation model, age is\nthe predictor (X), topological reorganization is the mediator at the\nsubsystem level (M), and the balance between integration and segregation\nat the system level is the moderator (W)\n# Discussion\nHealthy aging is associated with a heterogeneous decline across\ncognitive functions, including language. However, the neural mechanisms\nunderlying this variability still need to be understood. In this study,\nwe leveraged resting-state fMRI and neuropsychological data from the\npopulation-based CamCAN cohort (Cam-CAN et al., 2014) to investigate the\nfunctional reorganization of the language connectome and its association\nwith age-related cognitive variability. Employing state-of-the-art graph\ntheoretical analysis, we developed a data-driven pipeline that\nintegrates both cerebral and cognitive levels of analysis.\nOur findings can be summarized in two categories, shedding light on the\nmechanisms that underlie the evolution of neurocognitive functioning\nacross the lifespan. First, at the cognitive level, we demonstrate that\nlanguage processing is not an isolated function but is modulated\nthroughout an individual’s lifespan by the extent of inter-cognitive\nsynergy between language, long-term memory, and executive functions.\nThis modulation offers a potential explanation for the observed\nvariability in language performances. Second, at the cerebral level, we\nreveal that the synergistic coupling between DMN and FPN regions may act\nas a compensatory mechanism to mitigate the loss in the specialization.\nImportantly, we propose that a loss in this synergistic processing\naround the fifth decade of life may trigger a transition in\nneurocognitive functioning associated with accelerated cognitive\ndecline.\nTaken together, the present study contributes to ground neurocognitive\naging as the study of a dynamical system which provides the basis for\n‘studying the emergent function and its efficiency’ (Naik et al., 2017;\nO’Byrne & Jerbi, 2022). Our findings can be formalized as a novel SENECA\nmodel (Synergistic, Economical, Nonlinear, Emergent, Cognitive Aging),\nintegrating connectomic and cognitive dimensions within a complex system\nperspective. SENECA furthers our understanding of the brain’s language\nprocesses and their implication on inter-cognitive functioning in\nhealthy aging.\n*Evidence for inter-cognitive functioning across the lifespan*\nAt a cognitive level, our results from canonical correlation analysis\n(section 3.4) offer a new quantitative framework that emphasizes the\nimplication of synergistic processing on age-related variability in\nlanguage abilities (Gatica et al., 2021; Muller et al., 2016).\nIndeed, we found that cognitive performances in healthy adults are\nprimarily influenced by the amount of semantic processing demanded by a\ntask. However, we also observed a dynamic interplay between language and\nexecutive functions, suggesting that the amount of inter-cognitive\nsynergy could modulate the effect of semantic processing on age-related\ncognitive decline. Indeed, our findings also suggest that a sudden shift\naround age 50 from better to worse performances in synergistic processes\n(i.e., verbal fluency, semantic abstraction, multitasking) is associated\nwith accelerated cognitive decline around the same age window in\nnon-semantic processes (i.e., phonological for language production and\nfluid processing for the Cattell task). Overall, this provides empirical\nsupport for the LARA model (Banjac et al., 2021), highlighting the\ninvolvement of executive processes during language production across the\nlifespan (Hoyau et al., 2018; Pistono et al., 2021; Shafto & Tyler,\n2014). This also reinforces the idea that language is more than just\nintra-linguistic processes, and interacts with other cognitive functions\n(Hagoort, 2016, 2023).\n*Dedifferentiation-Compensation mechanisms*\nAt a cerebral level, our study aligns with previous team work (Roger,\nRodrigues De Almeida, et al., 2022), suggesting language is an\ninteractive function whose neurocognitive architecture at rest (rs-LANG)\ninvolves an associative (RS NET1), sensorimotor (RS NET2), low-level\nattentional (RS NET3), and control-executive (RS NET4) subsystems (see\nsection 3.1).\nWithin a lifespan perspective, compositional analysis (section 3.2)\nsuggests that the cognitive decline observed in non-semantic processes\n(i.e., language production and fluid processing) is associated with\nreduced local efficiency of rs-LANG (Cao et al., 2014; Chong et al.,\n2019; Martin et al., 2022; Song et al., 2014) and reduced segregation in\nthe control-executive, and sensorimotor subsystems (Dosenbach et al.,\n2007; Grady et al., 2016). It highlights that a loss in functional\nspecialization, or dedifferentiation, drives cognitive decline in\nhealthy aging adults (Chan et al., 2014, 2017; Deery et al., 2023). In\ncontrast, enhanced integration of control-executive and sensorimotor\nregions within the language connectome may act as a compensatory\nmechanism, countering the effects of dedifferentiation (Cabeza et al.,\n2018). This compensatory integration is characterized by increased\nconnector nodes across the lifespan, essential for information transfer\n(Bagarinao et al., 2020) and task processing flexibility (Bertolero et\nal., 2015). Specifically, connector nodes confer integrative properties\nto the network by tuning the connectivity of their neighbors to preserve\nmodularity or functional specialization (Bertolero et al., 2018), which\nleads to better cognitive performances (Meunier et al., 2010),\nespecially during healthy aging (Meunier et al., 2009; Setton et al.,\n2021).\nWhile previous studies focused exclusively on how dedifferentiation\nmediates poorer performances in fluid intelligence (Mitchell et al.,\n2023) and long-term memory (Koen et al., 2020), this study aimed to\nmodel the neural mechanisms that bridge dedifferentiation and\ncompensation (section 3.3), and how the changes in this\ndedifferentiation-compensation dynamic relate to the age-related\nvariability in language abilities discussed previously. Overall, we\nsuggest that dedifferentiation-compensation follows the principle of the\neconomy of brain network organization (Bullmore & Sporns, 2012). To\nclarify, the reorganization of the language connectome may be governed\nby the balance efficiency-cost, which seeks to maximally mitigate\ncognitive decline for the minimal integration cost (Barbey, 2018).\nSpecifically, we identified two compensatory strategies that satisfy\nthis principle of economy. The first compensatory strategy relies on\nacquiring long-distance connections (i.e., inter-modular links) and is\nmost efficient in younger adulthood thanks to the coupling between DMN\nand FPN regions. The second compensatory strategy relies on acquiring\nshort-distance connections within subsystems and is primarily\nimplemented in older adulthood.\n*Accelerated cognitive decline emerges from the loss of DMN-FPN\ncoupling*\nAs age increases, we discuss how a change in the\ndedifferentiation-compensation dynamic will likely trigger an\nacceleration in cognitive decline in non-semantic (e.g., language\nproduction) and synergistic tasks (e.g., verbal fluency).\nIn younger adults, differentiation is implemented by deactivating\nprovincial nodes within subsystems, which provide segregative properties\nto the network (Bertolero et al., 2015; Guimerà & Amaral, 2005). In\ncontrast, compensatory integration may be implemented by the synergy\nbetween the DMN and FPN regions. Indeed, DMN regions may deactivate\n(i.e., satellite-to-peripheral) to offset the integration cost of\nlong-distance connections in the FPN regions (i.e.,\nprovincial-to-connector), thus satisfying the principle of economy. It\naligns with numerous studies indicating that the deactivation of DMN\nregions via peripheral hubs (Dohmatob et al., 2020) enhances the\ncoupling of DMN-FPN (Muller et al., 2016; Pistono et al., 2021).\nInterestingly, our results suggest that this DMN-FPN coupling may be\ndisrupted in older adults due to the increased scarcity of satellite\nnodes in the associative subsystem (RS NET1). Indeed, satellite nodes\ninitiate deactivation in the synergistic strategy (i.e.,\nsatellite-to-peripheral) and enhanced integration in the other strategy\n(i.e., satellite-to-connector). Hence, satellite nodes get more scarce\nas age increases in RS NET1. Based on our study, we suggest that this\nscarcity could change the way compensatory integration is carried out as\nage increases. Indeed, DMN regions may shift their connectivity patterns\nfrom deactivation (i.e., satellite-to-peripheral) to integration (i.e.,\nsatellite-to-connector), favoring the most direct reconfiguration\nmechanism which provides an inexpensive way to mitigate cognitive\ndecline. Interestingly, control-executive regions in older adults may\nalso switch to this strategy based on short-distance connections (i.e.,\nsatellite-to-connector) as inter-modular links are no longer\npre-allocated by DMN regions. Nonetheless, the switch of this strategy\nin DMN and FPN regions may be less efficient in mitigating cognitive\ndecline in the long-term due to the instability of short-distance,\nintra-modular connections. This is particularly manifest of a greater\ndedifferentiated system in older adults and also aligns with a more\ninefficient integration of long-distance connections (i.e.,\nprovincial-to-satellite instead of provincial-to-connector), further\nreducing the mitigating effect of integration.\nThese findings align with a recent study suggesting that a youth-like\nnetwork architecture is associated with more economical processing\n(Martin et al., 2022). Therefore, our findings (i) supports that an\nefficient reorganization most likely follows the principle of economy of\nbrain network organization, and also (ii) highlight that satellite nodes\nmay play a pivotal role in this economical reorganization across the\nlifespan, responsible for the shift of connectivity patterns of DMN\nregions. This aligns with the DECHA model (Default Executive Coupling\nHypothesis of Aging), which reports that older adults with reduced\ndeactivation in DMN regions fail to modulate control-executive regions\n(Spreng & Turner, 2019; Varangis et al., 2019). This also echoes recent\ntheoretical (Grasso et al., 2021; Varley et al., 2022) and empirical\nstudies (Luppi et al., 2022; Santos et al., 2023; Varley et al., 2023)\nsuggesting that higher-order interactions facilitate higher-level\ncognitive performances (Williams et al., 2022) such as cognitive control\n(Varley et al., 2023), particularly during healthy aging (Gatica et al.,\n2021).\n*A novel integrative and connectomic model: SENECA*\nAs Livneh (2023) suggested, we combine the cerebral and cognitive levels\nof analysis within a single integrative model: SENECA. The SENECA model\narticulates a cerebral (SE) and cognitive (CA) dimension, which embraces\na complex system perspective (NE). We borrow the name from the Seneca\neffect, generally found in complex systems, which denotes a slow rise\nfollowed by an abrupt decline (Bardi, 2017). Hereafter, we refer to the\nmodel as SENECA in uppercase and to the Seneca effect in lowercase\nletters.\nAlong the cerebral dimension (SE), we confirm that dedifferentiation and\ncompensation are two sides of the same coin (Deery et al., 2023; Naik et\nal., 2017; Stumme et al., 2020; Tognoli & Kelso, 2014). Specifically, we\nshow that higher-order interactions between subsystems are the way for\nthe brain to satisfy the balance between maximal cognitive efficiency\nand a minimal cost of integration across the lifespan. In sum, the\nsynergistic (S) coupling between DMN and FPN regions seems to follow the\nprinciple of the economy (E) of brain network organization (Bullmore &\nSporns, 2012; Martin et al., 2022).\nAlong the cognitive dimension (CA), we suggest that satellite nodes are\nthe currency of this economy. Specifically, accelerated cognitive (C)\ndecline in healthy aging (A) adults may stem from an increased scarcity\nof satellite nodes within the language connectome, which disrupts the\nway dedifferentiation and compensation are implemented, in turn\ndisrupting the DMN-FPN coupling that promotes mitigate cognitive decline\nmitigation.\nConsidering both dimensions together, we suggest that the synergistic\n(S) and economic (E) reorganization of the language connectome produces\na nonlinear (N) and emerging (E) dynamic of cognitive aging (CA). The\n‘nonlinear’ aspect is associated with the acceleration of the cognitive\ndecline in non-semantic and synergistic tasks, which could mark a\ntransition in neurocognitive functioning during the fifth decade of\nlife. The ‘emergent’ aspect suggests that the reorganization at the\nsubsystem level induces a dynamic at the system level that is more than\nthe sum of its parts (Pessoa, 2022; Piccinini, 2022). In line with\nStumme et al. (2022), this makes significant progress toward reconciling\ncognitive efficiency across topological levels of analysis.\n*Perspectives and limitations*\nTheoretically, SENECA embraces the notion of cognitomics (Roger et al.,\n2018) which proposes to consider the neuropsychological implications\nthat the connectomic architecture imposes on human cognition and\nbehavior. Specifically, we provide evidence that changes in the language\narchitecture mediates cognitive performances supported by intra-\n(language) and extra-linguistic sub-processes (long-term memory,\nexecutive functions), as reported conceptually (Hagoort, 2023; Roger,\nBanjac, et al., 2022) and empirically (Roger, Rodrigues De Almeida, et\nal., 2022). Within this cognitomic perspective, it seems that the\nre-allocation of inter- and intra-modular connections between subsystems\nprovides an appropriate topological framework to investigate the\ncognitive efficiency of compensatory integration across the lifespan. In\nfurther studies, we suggest that this framework could serve as the basis\nto examine how the mechanisms underlying this\ndedifferentiation-compensation dynamic may differ in clinical\npopulations.\nOur study also shows several methodological novelties. First, we propose\na data-driven pipeline that makes extensive use of compositional data\nanalysis (Greenacre, 2021; Smith et al., 2016) and demonstrate that\nisometric log-ratio transformation (ilr) is a valuable tool to model the\ndynamic of network communication within and between subsystems. Second,\nthe data-driven map presented in Figure 5A supports that simple\nbivariate correlations are sufficient to identify the amount of\ninter-cognitive synergy as a critical determinant of language function.\nThe map also provides a latent geometry of age-related language\nfunction, which particularly discriminates between key landmarks of\nlanguage processing: sentence comprehension (semantic, low synergy),\nlanguage production (phonological, mid-low synergy), and semantic\nabstraction (semantic, high synergy). This map suggests that topological\nroles (Guimerà & Amaral, 2005) provide a parsimonious framework to track\nthe mechanisms that implement the inter-cognitive synergy and can also\ndiscriminate between critical language tasks. Therefore, rs-LANG may be\nappropriate to investigate the age-related variability in language\nabilities, despite being based on a task fMRI atlas (Roger, Rodrigues De\nAlmeida, et al., 2022).\nOur study also shows several limitations. Descriptively, the\nprobabilistic analysis may only model the most potential topological\nrole for each region and age group. Therefore, it cannot identify all\nthe regions involved in the underlying mechanisms and fails to account\nfor inter-individual variability, especially in older adulthood (Stumme\net al., 2020). To clarify, two individuals may have the exact relative\ncount of connector nodes, but different regions may implement these\nroles. To mitigate this issue, we introduced a tolerance parameter in\nour analysis for modeling the trajectories with a probability very close\nto the top one. Nonetheless, longitudinal studies would be more\nappropriate to investigate the reconfiguration between topological\nroles.\nWe considered GAMs for estimating how the system-level dynamic modulates\nthe mediation effect of topological changes on age-related cognitive\ntasks. Although a direct estimation of nonlinear smooth functions within\nan ordinary SEM framework would make the causal model more rigorous,\nsuch a framework has yet to be reported in the literature and is likely\nto be computationally challenging. Although cross-sectional data may\nalso bias estimates in mediation analysis (Cole et al., 2013;\nLindenberger et al., 2011), a recent study comparing longitudinal,\ncross-sectional, and cohort effects on cognitive aging revealed that\nusing cross-sectional data is perfectly reasonable as long as no cohort\neffect is assumed (Sørensen et al., 2021). In the present study, no\ncohort effect is assumed, given that we estimated universal lifespan\ntrajectories only. Nonetheless, this opens up future perspectives to\ninvestigate how idiosyncratic mechanisms (Baciu et al., 2021) associated\nwith a high cognitive reserve (Pitarque et al., 2016; Solé-Padullés et\nal., 2009) could provide the basis for a more graceful decline as age\nadvances. Our findings suggest that subcortical structures such as the\nbilateral thalamus and putamen could also play a crucial role in these\nmechanisms in late adulthood.\nTopologically, current methods in graph theory follow the predicate that\ninter-regional interactions of interest are limited to dyadic\nrelationships: two regions connected by an edge (Battiston et al., 2020,\n2021). Therefore, graphs need help to fully account for the topological\ncharacteristics intrinsic to higher-level interactions, which cannot\nalways be modeled as the sum of dyadic interactions. Although dyadic\npatterns can often describe the structural architecture, the functional\ndynamics underlying complex cognitive functions such as language are\nimplemented by a distributed network of cortico-subcortical regions and\ntheir multilevel interactions (Gazzaniga et al., 2019; Giusti et al.,\n2016) suggesting higher-order coupling. In addition, several studies\nhave highlighted the redundant nature of specific higher-order motifs\n(Merchan & Nemenman, 2016), which can sometimes be fully described in\ndyadic relationships. Therefore, modeling higher-level interactions has\na robust statistical (Schneidman et al., 2006; Yu et al., 2011),\ntopological (Gardner et al., 2021; Giusti et al., 2015), and theoretical\njustification for quantifying how the synergy-redundancy balance evolves\nacross the lifespan to mitigate cognitive decline (Gatica et al., 2021;\nLuppi et al., 2022, 2023; Stanford et al., 2022).\nConsidering the breadth of current neuroimaging datasets, the use of\nsophisticated techniques designed to yield high inter- and low\nintra-individual variability is timely. The proportional thresholding\nfor the topological structure (Jiang et al., 2023) may lead to the\nexclusion of weaker edges that are neurobiologically meaningful (van\nden Heuvel et al., 2017). Therefore, assessing how a data-driven\ntopological filtering scheme such as OMST (Orthogonal Minimum Spanning\nTree; Dimitriadis et al., 2017; Martin et al., 2022) compares to\nproportional thresholding would provide new insight into how older\nadults navigate the trade-off between cognitive efficiency and the cost\nof synergistic reorganization.\n# Conclusion\nLanguage is an interactive function that embodies the complexity of\nhuman cognition. In this study, we aimed to clarify how language\nfunction is implemented at the cerebral level across an individual’s\nlifespan. We found that synergistic coupling between DMN and FPN regions\nmay be the way for the brain to maximally mitigate cognitive decline in\nlanguage production and verbal fluency while limiting the reorganization\ncost. Relatedly, a disruption of this coupling could mark a transition\nin neurocognitive functioning towards less synergistic processing around\nthe fifth decade of life. We summarize these findings in a novel\nintegrative and connectomic model called SENECA, which articulates a\ncerebral (S- synergistic E- economical) and cognitive (C- cognitive A-\naging) dimension within a complex systems perspective (N- nonlinear E-\nemergent).\n# Data availability {#data-availability .unnumbered}\nRaw data can be made available by the authors upon request.

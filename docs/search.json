Set up a username and password\nYou’ll also need to GUI for WSL. I recommend you install VcXsrv on your system, which is a free X-sever on Windows. After downloading and installing VcXsrv with default options, run Xlauch (which gets installed automatically) and perform the following configuration:\n\nDisplay setting: select multiple windows option\nClient startup: check the Start no client option\nExtra setting: make sure “Disable access control” is enabled and “native opengl” is disabled\nAdd this to your .bashrc file:\n echo \"export DISPLAY=\\$(grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf  | awk '{print \\$2; exit}'):0\" &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc\n echo \"export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=0\" &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc\n # For Windows 11 users, add this as well\n  echo \"export LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1\" &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc\nTry running glxgears. A window with three spinning gears should open.\nTroubleshooting:\n\nMake sure you are not using a VPN.\nGo to Control panel &gt; System and security &gt; Windows defender firewall &gt; Advanced settings &gt; Inbound rules and make sure that the VcXsrv rules are not set to block - if they are you will need to edit the VcXsrv rule and change it from block to allow."

    "text": "I’m 2nd-year PhD Student in Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience at LPNC, CNRS UMR 5105, UGA, Grenoble, France. My research project is about modeling how our brain reorganizes across the lifespan to preserve optimal cognitive (language) performances.\nSummary:\nCognitive neuroscience is undergoing a paradigm shift. The abundance of multimodal empirical data, coupled with the unprecendented computational capabilities, is helping to redefine the links between the brain and human behavior. The brain is now understood as a vast network of interactions between cerebral regions from which cognitive operations and processes emerge. Specifically, language functions (L) are not isolated but constantly interact with declarative memory (M) and executive functions (EF). However, the neural mechanisms underlying this L-M-EF dynamic remain unclear. This cognitomic perspective (structure-function-cognition) is closely linked to the identification of multimodal L-M-EF phenotypes, which will enable significant advances in both fundamental and clinical research (e.g. pre-habilitation & cognitive rehabilitation).\nThis project has a theoretical dimension, through the enrichment of a neurocognitive L-M-EF model, and a methodological dimension, through the fusion of multimodal data required to evaluate this model (i.e. structural, functional, cognitive-behavioral: cognitomic)."

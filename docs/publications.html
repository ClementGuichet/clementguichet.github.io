<p># Abstract {#abstract .unnumbered}</p>
<p>Healthy aging is associated with a heterogeneous decline across</p>
<p>cognitive functions, typically observed in language performances.</p>
<p>Examining resting-state fMRI and neuropsychological data from 628</p>
<p>healthy adults (age 18-88) from the CamCAN cohort, we performed</p>
<p>state-of-the-art graph theoretical analysis to uncover the neural</p>
<p>mechanisms underlying this cognitive variability. At the cognitive</p>
<p>level, our findings suggest that language processing is not an isolated</p>
<p>function but is modulated throughout an individual’s lifespan by the</p>
<p>extent of inter-cognitive synergy between language, long-term memory,</p>
<p>and executive functions. At the cerebral level, we show that the</p>
<p>coupling between DMN (Default Mode Network) and FPN (Fronto-Parietal</p>
<p>Network) regions may be the way for the brain to compensate for the</p>
<p>effects of dedifferentiation at a minimal cost, efficiently mitigating</p>
<p>the age-related cognitive decline in language production, fluid</p>
<p>processing, and verbal fluency. Notably, the dynamic of cognitive</p>
<p>resilience provided by this synergistic coupling seems to follow the</p>
<p>Seneca effect typically found in complex systems: a slow rise followed</p>
<p>by an abrupt decline. Specifically, we argue that reducing the DMN-FPN</p>
<p>coupling could trigger accelerated cognitive decline around age 50. We</p>
<p>summarize our findings in a novel SENECA model (Synergistic, Economical,</p>
<p>Nonlinear, Emergent, Cognitive Aging), integrating connectomic and</p>
<p>cognitive perspectives within a complex system perspective. Our study</p>
<p>furthers our understanding of the dedifferentiation-compensation</p>
<p>mechanisms that uphold inter-cognitive functioning during healthy aging</p>
<p>and suggests that the fifth decade of life could transition towards less</p>
<p>synergistic processing.</p>
<p>**Keywords:** language, healthy aging, synergy, functional</p>

<p># Introduction</p>
<p>The crucial need to comprehend the mechanisms that uphold normal</p>
<p>cognitive functioning during aging arises from the significant increase</p>
<p>in the proportion of older individuals (Antoniou &amp; Wright, 2017). A</p>
<p>gradual decline in cognitive abilities typically accompanies aging.</p>
<p>However, this decline is heterogeneous across cognitive functions, and</p>
<p>some of them, such as language, semantic memory, and vocabulary, tend to</p>
<p>be preserved longer (Harada et al., 2013). Therefore, this study aims to</p>
<p>shed light on the neural mechanisms that underpin this variability,</p>
<p>jointly exploring the functional brain architecture and cognitive</p>
<p>performance. Specifically, we hypothesize that changes in language</p>
<p>function across the lifespan are subserved by the reconfiguration of the</p>
<p>language neurocognitive architecture within the framework of an</p>
<p>inter-cognitive interaction between language, long-term memory, and</p>
<p>executive functions.</p>
<p>From a cognitive standpoint, language decline under the effect of age is</p>
<p>not uniform (Baciu et al., 2021). Although overall language performances</p>
<p>tend to be preserved, certain linguistic operations may be impaired with</p>
<p>age (Ramscar et al., 2014; Wlotko et al., 2010). Indeed, while language</p>
<p>comprehension demonstrates higher resilience to the effects of aging</p>
<p>(Diaz et al., 2016; Rossi &amp; Diaz, 2016), language production, which</p>
<p>involves word retrieval and generation (Baciu et al., 2016, 2021), tends</p>
<p>to be more significantly impaired with age (Evrard, 2002; Ramscar et</p>
<p>al., 2014). This is evident in tip-of-the-tongue situations, where</p>
<p>individuals experience a feeling of knowing the meaning of a word but</p>
<p>struggle to immediately recall and produce the word form (Burke et al.,</p>
<p>1991; Condret-Santi et al., 2013). This discrepancy between</p>
<p>comprehension and production can be attributed to the advantages of</p>
<p>semantic context and the accumulation of verbal knowledge throughout the</p>
<p>lifespan (Deary et al., 2009).</p>
<p>From a cerebral standpoint, brain networks may interact with one</p>
<p>another, reflecting how language adapts to socio-communicative contexts</p>
<p>by drawing memories, knowledge, and beliefs from long-term memory (Duff</p>
<p>&amp; Brown-Schmidt, 2012; Horton, 2007) under the control of executive</p>
<p>functions (Corballis, 2019; Hertrich et al., 2020). While long-term</p>
<p>memory provides ‘traffic’ content and coherency, executive functioning</p>
<p>provides flexibility and coordination to focus, plan, accomplish tasks,</p>
<p>and control emotions. In a previous teamwork (Roger, Banjac, et al.,</p>
<p>2022), our team proposed a theoretical framework that conceptualizes the</p>
<p>inter-cognitive synergy between language, long-term memory, and</p>
<p>executive functions at the cognitive level, L∪M (i.e.,</p>
<p>Language/union/Memory), and suggested that functional connectivity-based</p>
<p>interactions may implement this synergy at the neural level.</p>
<p>Indeed, based on a data-driven approach, the language neurocognitive</p>
<p>architecture based on extrinsic brain activity (Roger, Rodrigues De</p>
<p>Almeida, et al., 2022) has been highlighted as a language connectome</p>
<p>comprising four non-overlapping subsystems, each probabilistically</p>
<p>mapping onto known resting-state brain networks (i.e., RSNs; Ji et al.,</p>
<p>2019): core Language (Net1), Control-Executive (Net2), Conceptual</p>
<p>(Net3), and Sensorimotor (Net4). Interestingly, these findings indicate</p>
<p>that age-related decline in language production impacts the</p>
<p>extra-linguistic components (Net2 and Net3) beyond the typical core</p>
<p>language network (Hertrich et al., 2020). This suggests that language</p>
<p>performances in older adults could be determined by synergistic</p>
<p>processing (Gatica et al., 2021) or higher-order connectivity-based</p>
<p>interactions between regions that support control-executive and</p>
<p>conceptual processes. In light of the effect that the reconfiguration of</p>
<p>the language connectome has on language function, our team also proposed</p>
<p>adopting a ‘cognitomic’ perspective (Roger et al., 2018), which</p>
<p>emphasizes the neuropsychological implications that this connectomic</p>
<p>architecture has across the lifespan.</p>
<p>Within this cognitomic perspective, graph theory (Bullmore &amp; Sporns,</p>
<p>2009; Bullmore &amp; Bassett, 2011; Rubinov &amp; Sporns, 2010) is appropriate</p>
<p>to identify the neural substrates of this inter-cognitive synergy.</p>
<p>Specifically, the brain network can be characterized in terms of</p>
<p>integration and segregation properties (Cohen &amp; D’Esposito, 2016; Genon</p>
<p>et al., 2018) at different topological levels (i.e.,</p>
<p>whole-brain/system-level, modular/subsystem-level, and</p>
<p>region/nodal-level) (Farahani et al., 2019; Fornito et al., 2016).</p>
<p>Across the lifespan, cognitive efficiency is supported by a balance</p>
<p>between integrated and modular information processing (Bullmore &amp;</p>
<p>Sporns, 2012; Meunier et al., 2010; van den Heuvel &amp; Sporns, 2013). In</p>
<p>other words, optimal coordination of neural activity is based on the</p>
<p>homeostasis between integration and segregation properties (Cole et al.,</p>
<p>2013; Fornito et al., 2015).</p>
<p>In line with our previous findings (Roger, Rodrigues De Almeida, et al.,</p>
<p>2022), a recent systematic review of resting-state data studies reported</p>
<p>that reduced local efficiency at the system level, along with reduced</p>
<p>segregation and enhanced integration within and between RSNs at the</p>
<p>subsystem level, are the connectomic fingerprints of healthy aging with</p>
<p>an inflection point around the fifth decade of life (Deery et al.,</p>
<p>2023). However, a crucial challenge resides in understanding the</p>
<p>mechanisms that bridge reduced segregation with enhanced integration</p>
<p>(Stumme et al., 2020) and how these changes induce a dynamic at the</p>
<p>system level associated with cognitive performance as age advances.</p>
<p>Indeed, studies report contradictory findings depending on the</p>
<p>topological level of analysis. At the system level, age-related enhanced</p>
<p>integration (Battaglia et al., 2020) is generally associated with a</p>
<p>dedifferentiated system that fails to alternate efficiently between</p>
<p>integrative and segregative states of connectivity (Chan et al., 2014;</p>
<p>Chan et al., 2017). At a subsystem level, brain regions undergo a</p>
<p>similar dedifferentiation process associated with a loss in function</p>
<p>specialization (Goh et al., 2010; Park et al., 2004). This is primarily</p>
<p>reflected by reduced segregation and enhanced integration in the</p>
<p>sensorimotor and higher-order executive networks (Deery et al., 2023;</p>
<p>Wig, 2017). However, in contrast with the system level, enhanced</p>
<p>integration has been shown to be compensatory (Cabeza et al., 2018) with</p>
<p>direct benefits on preserving cognitive performances (Bertolero et al.,</p>
<p>2015; Meunier et al., 2010). Specifically, increased coupling between</p>
<p>DMN and control-executive regions across subnetworks has also been</p>
<p>linked with better global cognitive performances (Spreng et al., 2018;</p>
<p>Spreng &amp; Turner, 2019). Specifically, it appears that the deactivation</p>
<p>of DMN regions may be a key ingredient of cognitive resilience across</p>
<p>the lifespan or the capacity to mitigate the deleterious effect of</p>
<p>dedifferentiation (Deery et al., 2023; Grady et al., 2016; Singh-Manoux</p>
<p>et al., 2012; Varangis et al., 2019). Indeed, failing to deactivate the</p>
<p>DMN subnetwork seems to worsen performance in synergistic cognitive</p>
<p>functions, based on intra-linguistic and control-executive processes,</p>
<p>such as verbal fluency (Muller et al., 2016; Whiteside et al., 2016).</p>
<p>Overall, the main objective of this study is to investigate how the</p>
<p>reorganization of the language connectome relates to the variability of</p>
<p>cognitive performances across the lifespan. By assuming that language is</p>
<p>a complex function in synergy with long-term memory and executive</p>
<p>functions, we aimed to model how changes in the neural mechanisms that</p>
<p>support this inter-cognitive synergy underlie this variability. To</p>
<p>address this objective, we leveraged a population-based resting state</p>
<p>fMRI dataset from the CamCAN cohort (Cam-CAN et al., 2014) and applied</p>
<p>graph theoretical analyses to evaluate the reorganization of the</p>
<p>language connectome in terms of segregation and integration properties</p>
<p>at multiple topological scales of analysis.</p>
<p># Materials &amp; Methods</p>
<p>## Participants</p>
<p>We included 652 healthy adults from the Cambridge Center for Ageing and</p>
<p>Neuroscience project cohort (Cam-CAN et al., 2014). Further recruitment</p>
<p>information can be found in Taylor et al.&nbsp;(2017). Our analysis focused</p>
<p>exclusively on functional fMRI brain data obtained during a resting</p>
<p>state period. After careful examination, we had a final sample size of</p>
<p>628 participants (age range: 18-88; 320 females; 208 males). Several</p>
<p>participants were excluded from the analysis for various reasons,</p>
<p>including missing functional imaging data (N = 4), incomplete volume</p>
<p>acquisition (N = 4; one subject was retained with 74% of the total</p>
<p>number of volumes), unreliable CSF mask (N = 9), and having 10% or more</p>
<p>outlying volumes after preprocessing (M = 13.6, SD = 3.2, N = 8). Then,</p>
<p>we chose eight cognitive tasks to span a continuous spectrum from a high</p>
<p>to a low degree of synergy between language, long-term memory, and</p>
<p>executive functions (Table 1). Consequently, the dataset was further</p>
<p>reduced to 613 participants to analyze the relationship between brain</p>
<p>activity and cognition. Specifically, we excluded participants with more</p>
<p>than 3 missing neuropsychological scores and replaced the latter with</p>
<p>the appropriate median of the age decile for the remaining participants.</p>

<p>### Data Preprocessing</p>
<p>The rs-fMRI data underwent preprocessing using SPM12 (Welcome Department</p>
<p>of Imaging Neuroscience, UK, &lt;http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/&gt;) within</p>
<p>MATLAB R2020b (MathWorks Inc., Sherborn, MA, USA). We employed a</p>
<p>standard preprocessing pipeline (including realignment, reslicing,</p>
<p>co-registration, segmentation, normalization, and smoothing) similar to</p>
<p>that described in our previous work (see Roger et al., 2020) with</p>
<p>specific details mentioned in Appendix S1.</p>
<p>### Cerebral parcellation: the LANG connectome atlas</p>
<p>The LANG connectome atlas, referred to as the LANG atlas, comprises a</p>
<p>collection of 131 regions of interest (ROI) derived from a panel of 13</p>
<p>language fMRI tasks (see Roger, Rodrigues De Almeida, et al., 2022).</p>
<p>Each ROI is represented by a spherical region with a diameter of 6 mm,</p>
<p>centered on the MNI coordinates as proposed by Power et al.&nbsp;(2011). To</p>
<p>transform the LANG atlas, which is based on extrinsic fMRI activation,</p>
<p>into a resting-state LANG (rs-LANG) atlas consisting of ROIs derived</p>
<p>from the intrinsic activity, we labeled all LANG regions according to</p>
<p>their primary resting-state network (RSN) based on the Cole-Anticevic</p>
<p>Brainwide Net Partition (CAB-NP; Ji et al., 2019). We utilized a</p>
<p>publicly available volumetric version of the CAB-NP that was converted</p>
<p>to standard MNI space. By overlaying the volumetric RSN map onto the 131</p>
<p>regions (see Banjac et al., 2021), we determined the number of voxels</p>
<p>that overlapped between each region and each RSN. This approach ensured</p>
<p>accurate voxel-based labeling of each region to their primary RSN.</p>
<p>During the examination of the modular organization of rs-LANG (see</p>
<p>Figure 2), the RSN composition of a given subsystem was weighted by the</p>
<p>mean percentage of overlap between the primary RSN and each region of</p>
<p>the identified subsystem. This improvement led to a 12% increase in mean</p>
<p>accuracy.</p>
<p>### Resting-state LANG connectomes</p>
<p>Using the CONN toolbox (Behzadi et al., 2007), we conducted an</p>
<p>ROI-to-ROI analysis and generated a connectivity matrix of dimensions</p>
<p>131x131 for each participant. These connectivity matrices were</p>
<p>subsequently employed for network analysis. We disregarded negative</p>
<p>correlations by setting them to zero, consistent with previous studies</p>
<p>(Chong et al., 2019; Martin et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2011).</p>
<p>Additionally, we applied thresholding to each matrix at five sparsity</p>
<p>levels (10, 12, 15, 17, and 20%). This step aimed to reduce the presence</p>
<p>of spurious connections and was based on the most likely sparsity levels</p>
<p>known to produce a small-world organization, as outlined by Achard and</p>
<p>Bullmore (2007). Subsequently, the thresholded matrices were binarized</p>
<p>to generate five undirected graphs for each participant.</p>
<p>## Resting state LANG network analysis</p>
<p>The network analysis, or graph analysis, was employed to measure</p>
<p>information flow within each connectome (Rubinov &amp; Sporns, 2010).</p>
<p>Specifically, we assessed (i) the balance between functional integration</p>
<p>and segregation at the system level, (ii) the modularity at the</p>
<p>subsystem level, and (iii) the information transfer at the nodal level</p>
<p>by evaluating the topological role of each region.</p>
<p>### System-level analysis: integration vs.&nbsp;segregation balance assessment</p>
<p>Using the Brain Connectivity Toolbox (BCT) implemented in MATLAB 2020b</p>
<p>and available at &lt;https://www.nitrc.org/projects/bct/&gt; (Bullmore &amp;</p>
<p>Sporns, 2009), we extracted three key graph metrics: (1) global</p>
<p>efficiency (Eglob), (2) local efficiency (Eloc), and (3) clustering</p>
<p>coefficient (Clustcoeff). Globally, Eglob was calculated as the inverse</p>
<p>of the shortest path lengths or the average of unweighted efficiencies</p>
<p>across all pairs of nodes (Latora &amp; Marchiori, 2001). This metric</p>
<p>quantifies the efficiency of parallel information transmission across</p>
<p>the global network (Bullmore &amp; Bassett, 2011). Locally, Eloc is similar</p>
<p>to Eglob but on node neighborhoods. When averaged at the system level,</p>
<p>it illustrates the segregation property of a network for processing</p>
<p>information (Latora &amp; Marchiori, 2001). For each node, the clustering</p>
<p>coefficient (Clustcoeff) was calculated as the fraction of a node’s</p>
<p>neighbors that are also neighbors of each other (Rubinov &amp; Sporns, 2010)</p>
<p>and averaged at the system level. We visually inspected Eglob and</p>
<p>Clustcoeff across the five sparsity levels and determined that the</p>
<p>optimal threshold that balances integrated and modular processing was</p>
<p>15% (Figure S2, Appendix S2). We further ensured that this threshold was</p>
<p>optimal by repeating the procedure for each age decile. Following this,</p>
<p>we reduced all graphs to a fixed number of edges by retaining the top</p>
<p>15% (2554 edges). Additionally, we verified that the reduced connectomes</p>
<p>maintained full connectivity and sufficiently devoided of isolated</p>
<p>nodes, meaning that the largest connected component (LCC) included at</p>
<p>least 80% of all nodes. After thresholding at 15%, we characterized the</p>
<p>balance between functional integration and segregation at the system</p>
<p>level by determining the relative predominance of global (Eglob) versus</p>
<p>local efficiency (Eloc). A higher balance reflects a higher predominance</p>
<p>of integration or higher integrative/global efficiency.</p>
<p>$$System - level\ balance\ (integration\ vs.\ segregation)\ = \frac{E_{glob}{- \ E}_{loc}}{E_{glob} + E_{loc}}$$</p>
<p>### Subsystem-level analysis: modularity assessment</p>
<p>To examine the modular organization of rs-LANG, we employed the Louvain</p>
<p>community detection algorithm (Blondel et al., 2008) with a resolution</p>
<p>parameter set to γ = 1.295, aiming to align with the RSNs identified in</p>
<p>the CAB-NP Atlas (Ji et al., 2019). As different runs of the algorithm</p>
<p>can yield varying optimal partitions, we implemented a consensus</p>
<p>clustering approach (Lancichinetti &amp; Fortunato, 2012). This approach</p>
<p>involves iteratively clustering co-assignment matrices until</p>
<p>convergence, aggregating the frequency of node assignments to the same</p>
<p>module. To reduce spurious node assignments, we applied a threshold of τ</p>
<p>= 0.5 to the co-assignment matrices (Jiang et al., 2021). If a node did</p>
<p>not consistently belong to the same module in at least 50% of the</p>
<p>iterations, its co-assignment weight was set to zero. We executed the</p>
<p>algorithm 1000 times for each subject and repeated the entire process</p>
<p>1000 times to generate a group-level consensus partition based on the</p>
<p>subject-level partitions. We ensured that this consensus partition</p>
<p>accurately represented all individuals across different ages, confirming</p>
<p>its suitability for statistical analysis (refer to Appendix S1 for</p>
<p>further information).</p>
<p>### Nodal-level analysis: topological roles</p>
<p>At the nodal level, we investigated the topological reorganization of</p>
<p>each connectome by defining four distinct topological roles: Connector,</p>
<p>Provincial, Satellite, and Peripheral (Bertolero et al., 2015; Guimerà &amp;</p>
<p>Amaral, 2005). Therefore, the composition of each individual’s language</p>
<p>connectome is represented by four percentages which add up to 100%. To</p>
<p>assign each role to a node (i.e., a region), we employed two graph</p>
<p>metrics, (i) the Within-Module Z-score (WMZ; Latora &amp; Marchiori, 2001),</p>
<p>which quantifies connectivity within subsystems (intra-modular), and</p>
<p>(ii) the normalized Participation Coefficient (PC; Pedersen et al.,</p>
<p>2019) which measures connectivity between subsystems (inter-modular)</p>
<p>while removing the bias associated with the number of nodes in each</p>
<p>module. Consistent with prior research (Roger, Rodrigues De Almeida, et</p>
<p>al., 2022; Schedlbauer &amp; Ekstrom, 2019), we standardized both metrics</p>
<p>(WMZ and zPCnorm) for each individual and assigned a topological role to</p>
<p>each node. In relation to the entire set of 131 regions, a Connector</p>
<p>node displays a high proportion of both intra- and inter-modular</p>
<p>connections (zPCnorm \&gt;= 0, WMZ \&gt;= 1e-5). A Provincial node displays a</p>
<p>high proportion of intra-modular connections (zPCnorm \&lt; 0, WMD \&gt;=</p>
<p>1e-5). A Satellite node displays a high proportion of inter-modular</p>
<p>connections (zPCnorm \&gt;= 0, WMZ \&lt; 1e-5). A Peripheral node, on the</p>
<p>other hand, displays a low proportion of all modular connections</p>
<p>(zPCnorm \&lt; 0, WMZ \&lt; 1e-5).</p>
<p>## Statistics</p>
<p>We conducted statistical analysis along four steps. Figure 1 illustrates</p>
<p>the analytical pipeline. First, we examined the evolution in the</p>
<p>proportion of topological roles across the lifespan using compositional</p>
<p>analysis techniques (Greenacre, 2021). Second, we modeled the neural</p>
<p>mechanisms that drive this evolution using probabilities. This allowed</p>
<p>us to uncover the patterns and principles governing the connectivity</p>
<p>changes in the language connectome across the lifespan. Third, we</p>
<p>employed a canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to examine the</p>
<p>many-to-many relationships between these neural mechanisms and the</p>
<p>changes in cognitive performances across the lifespan. Finally, CCA</p>
<p>analysis helped specify a causal model of how changes in the topological</p>
<p>properties of the language connectome, at the system and subsystem</p>
<p>levels, may explain the variability in age-related cognitive</p>
<p>performances.</p>

<p>**Figure 1.** Illustration of the analysis pipeline</p>
<p>### Compositional analysis of the language connectome</p>
<p>Due to the high correlation among components and the dependence on</p>
<p>pairwise covariance (Greenacre, 2021; Smith et al., 2016), the relative</p>
<p>count of topological roles was unsuitable for direct statistical</p>
<p>analysis. To address this issue, we used a log-based transformation that</p>
<p>mapped these counts to Euclidean space (i.e., isometric log-ratios</p>
<p>(ilr); Egozcue, 2003) (refer to Appendix S1 for more details). This</p>
<p>transformation allowed us to construct four log-contrasts, referred to</p>
<p>as compositional balances in our study, to capture the dynamics of each</p>
<p>role across the lifespan, specifically Connector, Provincial,</p>
<p>Peripheral, and Satellite (Eq. 1). To enhance the interpretability of</p>
<p>these log-contrasts and address potential issues regarding causality</p>
<p>(Ailer et al., 2021), we incorporated the count of all topological roles</p>
<p>into the equation. This ensured that an increase in the Connector</p>
<p>balance was necessarily driven by an increase in the absolute count of</p>
<p>connector nodes. Hereafter Eq.1 describes the compositional balances.</p>
<p>$$\mathbf{Connector\ balance = \ }\sqrt{\frac{3}{4}}\ \ln\left( \frac{Connector}{(Provincial \times Peripheral \times Satellite)^{\frac{1}{3}}} \right)$$</p>
<p>$${\mathbf{Provincial}\ \mathbf{balance} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}}\ \ln\left( \frac{Provincial}{(Connector \times Peripheral \times Satellite)^{\frac{1}{3}}} \right)</p>
<p>}{\mathbf{Peripheral\ balance}\ = \ \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}}\ \ln\left( \frac{Peripheral}{(Connector \times Provincial \times Satellite)^{\frac{1}{3}}} \right)}$$</p>
<p>$$\mathbf{Satellite\ balance}\ = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}}\ \ln\left( \frac{Satellite}{(Connector \times Provincial \times Peripheral)^{\frac{1}{3}}} \right)$$</p>
<p>Subsequently, for each compositional balance, we used generalized</p>
<p>additive models (GAM) with factor-smooth interactions to track the</p>
<p>evolution in the proportion of each topological role across the lifespan</p>
<p>within each subsystem of the resting-state language connectome (rs-LANG)</p>
<p>(Wood, 2006); mgcv package in R, Wood, 2017). For additional information</p>
<p>and specifics, please refer to Appendix S1.</p>
<p>### Probabilistic analysis of the neural mechanisms</p>
<p>To elucidate the neural mechanisms driving the evolution of the</p>
<p>proportion of topological roles (section 2.5.1), we modeled the</p>
<p>probability that each region changes its topological role across the</p>
<p>lifespan. Based on the compositional results (section 3.2), we</p>
<p>determined the most probable role of each region within three distinct</p>
<p>age groups: a younger group (18-45 excluded), a middle-aged group (45-55</p>
<p>included), and an older group (\&gt;55). Concretely, we first calculated</p>
<p>the probabilities for all pairwise trajectories between the younger and</p>
<p>middle-aged groups and then repeated the calculation between the</p>
<p>resulting non-zero trajectories and the older age group. To account for</p>
<p>the inter-individual variability within each age group, we considered</p>
<p>all the trajectories whose probability fell within a 5% range from the</p>
<p>highest probability for each region. Using this approach, we captured</p>
<p>for each region the most likely transitions of topological roles between</p>
<p>age groups while considering the variability within each age group.</p>
<p>### Canonical correlation analysis</p>
<p>To identify the many-to-many relationships between subsystem-level</p>
<p>balances (brain set) and neuropsychological scores (cognitive set), we</p>
<p>conducted a canonical correlation analysis (CCA). CCA works by finding</p>
<p>the linear combinations within the brain and cognitive set of variables</p>
<p>that maximize the correlation between the two sets (Wang et al., 2020).</p>
<p>The analysis produces a number of canonical functions equal to the</p>
<p>number of variables within the smaller set (viz., eight functions for</p>
<p>the eight variables of the cognitive set). Each canonical function is</p>
<p>composed of two variates: a latent brain and cognitive variable (Sherry</p>
<p>&amp; Henson, 2005). To address the issue of multicollinearity among brain</p>
<p>variables inherent to compositional data, we ran two CCA models: one</p>
<p>excluding the Satellite balances and the other excluding the Peripheral</p>
<p>balances of each subsystem. Both CCA models yielded identical structure</p>
<p>coefficients ($r_{s}$), representing the correlations between the</p>
<p>observed variables and the variates and identical latent coordinates for</p>
<p>the variates, although with different linear combinations (*b;* function</p>
<p>coefficients). This approach allowed us to construct a latent</p>
<p>correlational space based on the cognitive variate-cognitive variable</p>
<p>and cognitive variate-brain variable correlations.</p>
<p>### Causal analysis</p>
<p>Based on the results from the CCA analysis, we proposed a causal model</p>
<p>that integrates age (X), cognitive performance (Y), subsystem</p>
<p>reconfiguration of the resting-state language connectome, as measured by</p>
<p>the compositional balances (M), and the balance between integration and</p>
<p>segregation properties at the system level (W). Using the lavaan package</p>
<p>in R (Rosseel, 2012), we examined how a higher integrative efficiency</p>
<p>(W) may mitigate cognitive decline by reducing the mediation effect (X</p>
<p>-\&gt; M -\&gt; Y). To achieve this, we tested for indirect path moderation</p>
<p>using an index of moderated mediation and a simple slope analysis should</p>
<p>the index be significant (Hayes, 2018). For more details, please refer</p>
<p>to Appendix S1.</p>
<p># Results</p>
<p>## Modular organization of the Language connectome at rest (rs-LANG)</p>
<p>Applying modularity analysis to the resting-state Language connectome</p>
<p>(rs-LANG) uncovered four main subsystems. Figure 2 provides a visual</p>
<p>representation of these subsystems. Appendix S2 provides a detailed</p>
<p>comparison with the task-based modular organization of the same</p>
<p>connectome, described by Roger, Rodrigues De Almeida, et al.&nbsp;(2022).</p>
<p>Considering the composition, the largest subsystem, RS NET1 (40</p>
<p>regions), is composed of 66.4% of DMN regions known to be involved in</p>
<p>higher-level cognitive function and can thus be regarded as the</p>
<p>associative subsystem. The second largest subsystem, RS NET2 (34</p>
<p>regions), is saturated by sensorimotor regions (SMN; 77.1%) along with</p>
<p>contributions from CON regions (15.3%) and can thus be regarded as the</p>
<p>sensorimotor subsystem. The third largest subsystem, RS NET3 (32</p>
<p>regions), engages the cingulo-opercular network (CON; 56.4%), a broader</p>
<p>network encompassing the salience network (SAL) and known to support</p>
<p>low-level attentional redirection. It can thus be regarded as the</p>
<p>low-level attentional subsystem. The smallest subsystem, RS NET4 (22</p>
<p>regions), is saturated by FPN regions (63.1%), with nontrivial</p>
<p>contributions from CON regions as well (17.2%), and can thus be regarded</p>
<p>as the control-executive subsystem. In addition, RS NET1 &amp; 3 are</p>
<p>supported by FPN regions (13.8% &amp; 11.8%), and RS NET1, 3, and 4 by</p>
<p>Language regions (13%, 10.8%, 8.6%).</p>

<p>## Compositional analysis of the language connectome</p>
<p>Overall, we found that healthy aging is associated with reduced local</p>
<p>efficiency (*t* = -10.37, p \&lt; .001, $\eta_{2p}$ = .15, 95% CI \[.11;</p>
<p>Inf\]) and preserved global efficiency (*t* = -1.14, p = .26), which</p>
<p>tilts the balance between integration and segregation towards a higher</p>
<p>integrative efficiency as age increases (*t* = 9.71, p \&lt; .001,</p>
<p>$\eta_{2p}$ = .13, 95% CI \[.09; Inf\]) (see Figure 3A).</p>
<p>Considering the evolution of topological roles (Figure 3B), we found</p>
<p>that healthy aging is associated with a decrease in the proportion of</p>
<p>provincial nodes (*b* = -0.07 95% CI \[-0.09; -0.05\]; F(1, 624) = 52.5;</p>
<p>p \&lt; .001; $\eta_{p}^{2}$ = .08) and satellite nodes (*b* = -0.03 95% CI</p>
<p>\[-0.04; -0.01\]; F(1, 624) = 20.3; p \&lt; .001; $\eta_{p}^{2}$ = .03),</p>
<p>which is contrasted by an increase in the proportion of connector nodes</p>
<p>(*b* = 0.04 95% CI \[0.02; 0.05\]; F(1, 624) = 31.5; p \&lt; .001;</p>
<p>$\eta_{p}^{2}$ = .05) and peripheral nodes (*b* = 0.04 95% CI \[0.02;</p>
<p>0.05\]; F(1, 624) = 25.6; p \&lt; .001; $\eta_{p}^{2}$ = .04).</p>
<p>Considering the significant changes at the subsystem level (Figure 3C),</p>
<p>we found that, in RS NET4, the rate of loss of provincial nodes (F =</p>
<p>29.8, p \&lt; .001, *edf* = 1), the rate of gain of connector nodes (F =</p>
<p>13.6, p \&lt; .001, *edf* = 1) and peripheral nodes (F = 6.5, p = .02,</p>
<p>*edf* = 1) remains constant across the lifespan, while the loss of</p>
<p>satellite nodes stabilizes around age 50 (F = 5.1, p = .007, *edf* =</p>
<p>2.1). Interestingly, in RS NET1, we observed a dynamic of</p>
<p>reconfiguration centered around this age window: while the rate of loss</p>
<p>of satellite nodes remains constant (F = 15.5, p \&lt; .001, *edf* = 1),</p>
<p>the rate of gain of peripheral nodes in RS NET1 (F = 6.7, p = .001,</p>
<p>*edf* = 2.27) gets slower and the rate of gain of connector nodes tends</p>
<p>to accelerate (F = 2, p = .18, *edf* = 2.37). In contrast, while the</p>
<p>rate of loss of provincial nodes being quite constant (F = 6.8, p = .01,</p>
<p>*edf* = 1.31), the rate of gain of connector nodes (F = 3.81, p = .034,</p>
<p>*edf* = 2.23) slows down but that of peripheral nodes tends to</p>
<p>accelerate (F = 1.9, p = .17, *edf* = 2.42). Overall, this suggests</p>
<p>that, around age 50, RS NET4 stops losing satellite nodes and that</p>
<p>changes in the connectivity patterns of RS NET1 and 2 are mirrored.</p>

<p>## Probabilistic analysis of the neural mechanisms</p>
<p>Probabilistic analysis revealed that 35.8% of the language connectome</p>
<p>(47 regions) undergoes a topological reorganization across the lifespan.</p>
<p>Across subsystems, 50% of RS NET4, 50% of RS NET2, and 34% of RS NET1</p>
<p>regions reconfigure, whereas regions in RS NET3 are more inflexible</p>
<p>(24.3%). A web app is available to explore the reconfiguration</p>
<p>cross-sectionally: &lt;https://lpnc-lang.shinyapps.io/seneca/&gt;. To account</p>
<p>for inter-individual variability, we consider 16 additional</p>
<p>trajectories, which are also highly probable (see section 2.5.2 for</p>
<p>details on the calculations), which amounts to 63 trajectories in total</p>
<p>and is the number of references for the results below.</p>
<p>As suggested by compositional analysis, we found that functional</p>
<p>integration, via the gain of connector nodes, is driven by the</p>
<p>reconfiguration of provincial and satellite nodes.</p>
<p>Considering provincial nodes, the decrease is mostly due to the</p>
<p>acquisition of new between-subsystem connections or inter-modular links</p>
<p>(i.e., provincial-to-connector; 30.1% of all reconfigurations), 52.6%</p>
<p>before and 47.4% after age 45-55. Specifically, we notice that RS NET4,</p>
<p>which accounts for 31.5% of these acquisitions, tends to acquire them</p>
<p>before age 45-55 (83.3%), whereas RS NET2, which accounts for 57.8% of</p>
<p>these acquisitions, continues to acquire them after age 45-55 (63.6%).</p>
<p>In addition, we notice that the number of regions failing to acquire</p>
<p>these properties doubles across the lifespan for RS NET4 (i.e.,</p>
<p>provincial-to-satellite reconfigurations instead of</p>
<p>provincial-to-connector) and starts appearing in RS NET1. This</p>
<p>highlights the greater instability of intra-modular links after age</p>
<p>45-55 in RS NET1 &amp; 4.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we observed that this dynamic correlates a change in the</p>
<p>way reduced segregation is conducted across the lifespan (i.e.,</p>
<p>provincial-to-peripheral; 9.5% of all reconfigurations). Indeed, reduced</p>
<p>segregation is dominated by RS NET1 (right MTG; 92% FPN, right BA44; 72%</p>
<p>DMN) and complemented by RS NET4 (left IFG; 99% FPN) before age 45-55,</p>
<p>and after age 45-55 is dominated by RS NET2 (right SMA; SMN, left</p>
<p>paracentral lobule; 74% DMN) and complemented by RS NET1 (left insula;</p>
<p>72% DMN).</p>
<p>Considering satellite nodes, we found the opposite pattern. The decrease</p>
<p>is mostly due to the acquisition of new within-subsystem connections or</p>
<p>intra-modular links (i.e., satellite-to-connector; 20.6% of all</p>
<p>reconfigurations), 69.2% of which occur after age 45-55. Specifically,</p>
<p>RS NET3 and RS NET4, which respectively account for 38.4% and 15.3% of</p>
<p>these acquisitions, tend to acquire them after age 45-55 (80% and 100%),</p>
<p>whereas RS NET2 and 1, which respectively accounts for 30.7%, and 15.3%</p>
<p>of these acquisitions, tends to acquire them in equal proportions across</p>
<p>the lifespan. In addition, we notice that this acquisition may be</p>
<p>inefficient after age 45-55, given the opposite connector-to-satellite</p>
<p>reconfigurations in RS NET1, 2, and 4 (8% of all reconfigurations).</p>
<p>Interestingly, we observed that this dynamic correlates with a change in</p>
<p>the way deactivation is conducted across the lifespan (i.e.,</p>
<p>satellite-to-peripheral; 9.5% of all reconfigurations). Indeed, this</p>
<p>mechanism occurs exclusively before age 45-55 (5 out of 6 trajectories:</p>
<p>83.3%; 1 out of 6 being in RS NET4) and is most likely to be implemented</p>
<p>by RS NET1 (left fusiform area; 63% DAN, 37% DMN; left paracentral</p>
<p>lobule; 93% DMN; left pCC 68% DMN) as well as in bilateral postcentral</p>
<p>regions in RS NET3 (95% SMN).</p>
<p>To summarize, probabilistic analysis helps us clarify the dynamic of</p>
<p>reconfiguration of the language connectome across the lifespan based on</p>
<p>the reallocation of inter- and intra-modular links. As illustrated in</p>
<p>Figure 4, this suggests two strategies for acquiring connector</p>
<p>properties across the lifespan: (i) an efficient, synergistic strategy</p>
<p>based on inter-modular links and the coupling between RS NET1 and RS</p>
<p>NET4, which is implemented before age 45-55; (ii) an inefficient</p>
<p>strategy based on intra-modular links, which occurs primarily in older</p>
<p>adults. The detail of the regions involved in all mechanisms can be</p>
<p>found in Appendix S3.</p>

<p>efficient in younger adults. (ii) an inexpensive strategy based on links</p>
<p>within subsystems (intra-links) which occurs primarily in older adults</p>
<p>## Canonical correlation analysis</p>
<p>Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) yielded two significant canonical</p>
<p>functions, each composed of a cognitive and brain variate, which</p>
<p>maximize the correlation between the brain and cognitive set of</p>
<p>variables ($R_{c1}$ = .28; $R_{c1}²$ = 8%, p \&lt; .001; $R_{c1}$ = .25;</p>
<p>$R_{c2}²$ = 6%, p \&lt; .001). We examine these results in two steps. In</p>
<p>the first step, we analyze the organization of the age-related</p>
<p>performances in the eight cognitive tasks based on the two cognitive</p>
<p>variates (section 3.1.1.). In the second step, we identify the brain</p>
<p>variables associated with this organization (section 3.1.2.).</p>
<p>### Effect of age on cognitive functions</p>
<p>Based on the correlations between the two cognitive variates and each</p>
<p>cognitive variable (i.e., structure coefficients; $r_{s\ }$), we built</p>
<p>the corresponding cognitive map shown in Figure 5A. By relating the</p>
<p>age-related performances of the eight cognitive tasks (Figure 5C, Table</p>
<p>2) with the cognitive map, we found that cognitive decline can be</p>
<p>predicted by two factors.</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Cognitive variables Goodness-of-fit of Age as a predictor (Deviance</p>
<p>explained in %)</p>
<p>-------------------- --------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Cattell 42.9</p>
<p>Naming 41.4</p>
<p>LTM 14.8</p>
<p>Verbal Fluency 14.1</p>
<p>Tip-of-the-tongue 13</p>
<p>Multitasking 8.75</p>
<p>Sentence 6.02</p>
<p>Comprehension</p>
<p>Proverb 3.74</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>**Table 2.** Estimates from generalized additive models (GAMs):</p>
<p>Cognitive variable **\~** s(Age). All models are significant at p \&lt;</p>
<p>.001 ‘\*\*\*’. Deviance explained is used as a proxy for the amount of</p>
<p>age-related cognitive decline</p>
<p>The first factor may correspond to the amount of semantic processing</p>
<p>associated with a task. Given the high correlation between the deviance</p>
<p>reported in Table 2 (r = -.94, p \&lt; .001) and the coordinates of</p>
<p>cognitive tasks on this factor, we suggest that semantic processing is</p>
<p>the main predictor of age-related cognitive performances. In other</p>
<p>words, the first factor discriminates non-semantic tasks, which tend to</p>
<p>decline the most (fluid processing: r~\_Cattell~ = -.8; phonological</p>
<p>access: r~\_Naming~ = -.78) from semantic tasks which tend to decline</p>
<p>the least (semantic access: r~\_Comprehension~ = -.27; lexical</p>
<p>retrieval: r~\_ToT~ = -.26; semantic abstraction: r~\_Proverb~ = .06).</p>
<p>Based on the description of the processes recruited for each cognitive</p>
<p>task (see Table 1, section 2.1), the second factor may correspond to the</p>
<p>amount of synergy between language, long-term memory, and executive</p>
<p>functions associated with a task. Interestingly, synergistic task</p>
<p>performances have a nonlinear relationship with age. Indeed, Figure 5B</p>
<p>illustrates a shift around age 50 from an increase to a decrease in</p>
<p>performance (F = 5.6, p \&lt; .001, *edf* = 2.7). Therefore, this second</p>
<p>factor may discriminate the highly synergistic tasks which follow this</p>
<p>shift (r~\_Proverb~ = -.68, r~\_Multitasking~ = -.59,</p>
<p>r~\_Verbal_Fluency~ = -.53) from the less synergistic tasks which do not</p>
<p>(r~\_Comprehension~ = -.04, r~\_LTM~ = -.07, and r~\_Cattell~ = -.08).</p>
<p>In addition, this decrease in synergistic task performances is</p>
<p>associated with accelerated cognitive decline in non-semantic tasks</p>
<p>around the same age window (F = 119, p \&lt; .001, *edf* = 4.9; Figure 5B).</p>

<p>the cognitive decline in non-semantic tasks (yellow), suggesting that</p>
<p>the amount of synergy mitigates the decline in non-semantic tasks before</p>
<p>age 50. Panel C. Age-related performances of the eight cognitive tasks</p>

<p>### Effect of age on cognitive functions and cerebral correlates</p>
<p>We identified the brain variables that correlate with the task</p>
<p>performances of the first cognitive variate, which is the variate that</p>
<p>combines the factors identified in the previous section. As illustrated</p>
<p>by the grey trajectory in Figure 5A, a high correlation with the first</p>
<p>cognitive variate (e.g., r~\_Naming~ = -.7, r~\_Cattell~ = -.63,</p>
<p>r~\_Verbal_Fluency~ = -.62) suggests that performances tend to increase</p>
<p>before accelerating around age 50-55. Therefore, the brain changes that</p>
<p>are also highly correlated with this variate may be associated with this</p>
<p>dynamic.</p>
<p>Below, we only considered the brain variables that showed a significant</p>
<p>or tendency for change across the lifespan (see section 3.2). In line</p>
<p>with probabilistic analysis (section 3.3), Figure 6 illustrates that the</p>
<p>dynamic of the first cognitive variate is primarily associated with</p>
<p>provincial-to-connector reconfigurations in RS NET4 and</p>
<p>satellite-to-peripheral reconfigurations in RS NET1. This further</p>
<p>suggests that a coupling between deactivation in RS NET1 and integration</p>
<p>in RS NET4 is responsible for cognitive performance variations across</p>
<p>the lifespan. Moreover, Figure 6 suggests that the shift around age 50</p>
<p>in the performances of synergistic tasks driven by a shift in the</p>
<p>connectivity patterns in RS NET1 from deactivation towards integration.</p>
<p>This particularly highlights the pivotal role of satellite nodes, as</p>
<p>previously identified in Figure 4 (section 3.3).</p>

<p>height=“4.673611111111111in”}**Figure 6.** Neurocognitive map of healthy</p>
<p>aging. Coordinates represent the correlations between topological</p>
<p>changes in the language connectome and the cognitive variates (i.e.,</p>
<p>cross-loadings). The shift around age 50 corresponds to a shift from</p>
<p>deactivation to integration of DMN regions which disrupts the DMN-FPN</p>
<p>coupling that mitigates cognitive decline. The black box in the bottom</p>
<p>left can be viewed in full size in Figure 5A</p>
<p>## Causal analysis</p>
<p>Based on the results of canonical correlation analysis, we hypothesized</p>
<p>that the synergy between deactivation in RS NET1 and integration in RS</p>
<p>NET4 may mitigate cognitive decline before age 50, whereas a loss of</p>
<p>this coupling may accelerate cognitive decline after age 50. Therefore,</p>
<p>we examined whether the reorganization at the subsystem level, which we</p>
<p>described in the previous section, induces a high integrative efficiency</p>
<p>at the system level (balance integration/segregation) to mitigate this</p>
<p>decline (see Figure S4, Appendix S2 for an illustration of the model).</p>
<p>As expected, at the subsystem level, we found that the reorganization of</p>
<p>the language connectome (i.e., less provincial nodes in RS NET4 and 2</p>
<p>and more connector nodes in RS NET4 coupled with more peripheral nodes</p>
<p>in RS NET1) mediates cognitive decline (mediation (a\*b1): *z* = 3.672,</p>
<p>p \&lt; .001) in non-semantic or highly synergistic tasks (r\_~Naming~ =</p>
<p>-.69, r\_~Cattell~ = -.63, r\_~Verbal_Fluency~ = -.62, r\_~Multitasking~</p>
<p>= -.55, r\_~Proverb~ = -.43). Nonetheless, it seems that this</p>
<p>reorganization also induces a high integrative efficiency at the system</p>
<p>level (a\*d1: *z* = -2.21, p = .003) which partially mitigates this</p>
<p>decline (moderated mediation (a\*b2): *z* = -2.2, p = .03). Indeed,</p>
<p>Figure 7 clarifies that a high integrative efficiency gradually</p>
<p>mitigates cognitive decline until a tipping point around age 54 (Figure</p>
<p>7; full tensor product: *edf* = 7.377, F = 50.1, p \&lt; .001). line with</p>
<p>our previous analyses, this could suggest a sudden loss in synergistic</p>
<p>processing ![](media/image8.png){width=“5.7659722222222225in”</p>
<p>height=“4.162742782152231in”}between RS NET1 and RS NET4.</p>

<p># Discussion</p>
<p>Healthy aging is associated with a heterogeneous decline across</p>
<p>cognitive functions, including language. However, the neural mechanisms</p>
<p>underlying this variability still need to be understood. In this study,</p>
<p>we leveraged resting-state fMRI and neuropsychological data from the</p>
<p>population-based CamCAN cohort (Cam-CAN et al., 2014) to investigate the</p>
<p>functional reorganization of the language connectome and its association</p>
<p>with age-related cognitive variability. Employing state-of-the-art graph</p>
<p>theoretical analysis, we developed a data-driven pipeline that</p>
<p>integrates both cerebral and cognitive levels of analysis.</p>
<p>Our findings can be summarized in two categories, shedding light on the</p>
<p>mechanisms that underlie the evolution of neurocognitive functioning</p>
<p>across the lifespan. First, at the cognitive level, we demonstrate that</p>
<p>language processing is not an isolated function but is modulated</p>
<p>throughout an individual’s lifespan by the extent of inter-cognitive</p>
<p>synergy between language, long-term memory, and executive functions.</p>
<p>This modulation offers a potential explanation for the observed</p>
<p>variability in language performances. Second, at the cerebral level, we</p>
<p>reveal that the synergistic coupling between DMN and FPN regions may act</p>
<p>as a compensatory mechanism to mitigate the loss in the specialization.</p>
<p>Importantly, we propose that a loss in this synergistic processing</p>
<p>around the fifth decade of life may trigger a transition in</p>
<p>neurocognitive functioning associated with accelerated cognitive</p>
<p>decline.</p>
<p>Taken together, the present study contributes to ground neurocognitive</p>
<p>aging as the study of a dynamical system which provides the basis for</p>
<p>‘studying the emergent function and its efficiency’ (Naik et al., 2017;</p>
<p>O’Byrne &amp; Jerbi, 2022). Our findings can be formalized as a novel SENECA</p>
<p>model (Synergistic, Economical, Nonlinear, Emergent, Cognitive Aging),</p>
<p>integrating connectomic and cognitive dimensions within a complex system</p>
<p>perspective. SENECA furthers our understanding of the brain’s language</p>
<p>processes and their implication on inter-cognitive functioning in</p>
<p>healthy aging.</p>
<p>*Evidence for inter-cognitive functioning across the lifespan*</p>
<p>At a cognitive level, our results from canonical correlation analysis</p>
<p>(section 3.4) offer a new quantitative framework that emphasizes the</p>
<p>implication of synergistic processing on age-related variability in</p>
<p>language abilities (Gatica et al., 2021; Muller et al., 2016).</p>
<p>Indeed, we found that cognitive performances in healthy adults are</p>
<p>primarily influenced by the amount of semantic processing demanded by a</p>
<p>task. However, we also observed a dynamic interplay between language and</p>
<p>executive functions, suggesting that the amount of inter-cognitive</p>
<p>synergy could modulate the effect of semantic processing on age-related</p>
<p>cognitive decline. Indeed, our findings also suggest that a sudden shift</p>
<p>around age 50 from better to worse performances in synergistic processes</p>
<p>(i.e., verbal fluency, semantic abstraction, multitasking) is associated</p>
<p>with accelerated cognitive decline around the same age window in</p>
<p>non-semantic processes (i.e., phonological for language production and</p>
<p>fluid processing for the Cattell task). Overall, this provides empirical</p>
<p>support for the LARA model (Banjac et al., 2021), highlighting the</p>
<p>involvement of executive processes during language production across the</p>
<p>lifespan (Hoyau et al., 2018; Pistono et al., 2021; Shafto &amp; Tyler,</p>
<p>2014). This also reinforces the idea that language is more than just</p>
<p>intra-linguistic processes, and interacts with other cognitive functions</p>
<p>(Hagoort, 2016, 2023).</p>
<p>*Dedifferentiation-Compensation mechanisms*</p>
<p>At a cerebral level, our study aligns with previous team work (Roger,</p>
<p>Rodrigues De Almeida, et al., 2022), suggesting language is an</p>
<p>interactive function whose neurocognitive architecture at rest (rs-LANG)</p>
<p>involves an associative (RS NET1), sensorimotor (RS NET2), low-level</p>
<p>attentional (RS NET3), and control-executive (RS NET4) subsystems (see</p>
<p>section 3.1).</p>
<p>Within a lifespan perspective, compositional analysis (section 3.2)</p>
<p>suggests that the cognitive decline observed in non-semantic processes</p>
<p>(i.e., language production and fluid processing) is associated with</p>
<p>reduced local efficiency of rs-LANG (Cao et al., 2014; Chong et al.,</p>
<p>2019; Martin et al., 2022; Song et al., 2014) and reduced segregation in</p>
<p>the control-executive, and sensorimotor subsystems (Dosenbach et al.,</p>
<p>2007; Grady et al., 2016). It highlights that a loss in functional</p>
<p>specialization, or dedifferentiation, drives cognitive decline in</p>
<p>healthy aging adults (Chan et al., 2014, 2017; Deery et al., 2023). In</p>
<p>contrast, enhanced integration of control-executive and sensorimotor</p>
<p>regions within the language connectome may act as a compensatory</p>
<p>mechanism, countering the effects of dedifferentiation (Cabeza et al.,</p>
<p>2018). This compensatory integration is characterized by increased</p>
<p>connector nodes across the lifespan, essential for information transfer</p>
<p>(Bagarinao et al., 2020) and task processing flexibility (Bertolero et</p>
<p>al., 2015). Specifically, connector nodes confer integrative properties</p>
<p>to the network by tuning the connectivity of their neighbors to preserve</p>
<p>modularity or functional specialization (Bertolero et al., 2018), which</p>
<p>leads to better cognitive performances (Meunier et al., 2010),</p>
<p>especially during healthy aging (Meunier et al., 2009; Setton et al.,</p>
<p>2021).</p>
<p>While previous studies focused exclusively on how dedifferentiation</p>
<p>mediates poorer performances in fluid intelligence (Mitchell et al.,</p>
<p>2023) and long-term memory (Koen et al., 2020), this study aimed to</p>
<p>model the neural mechanisms that bridge dedifferentiation and</p>
<p>compensation (section 3.3), and how the changes in this</p>
<p>dedifferentiation-compensation dynamic relate to the age-related</p>
<p>variability in language abilities discussed previously. Overall, we</p>
<p>suggest that dedifferentiation-compensation follows the principle of the</p>
<p>economy of brain network organization (Bullmore &amp; Sporns, 2012). To</p>
<p>clarify, the reorganization of the language connectome may be governed</p>
<p>by the balance efficiency-cost, which seeks to maximally mitigate</p>
<p>cognitive decline for the minimal integration cost (Barbey, 2018).</p>
<p>Specifically, we identified two compensatory strategies that satisfy</p>
<p>this principle of economy. The first compensatory strategy relies on</p>
<p>acquiring long-distance connections (i.e., inter-modular links) and is</p>
<p>most efficient in younger adulthood thanks to the coupling between DMN</p>
<p>and FPN regions. The second compensatory strategy relies on acquiring</p>
<p>short-distance connections within subsystems and is primarily</p>
<p>implemented in older adulthood.</p>
<p>*Accelerated cognitive decline emerges from the loss of DMN-FPN</p>
<p>coupling*</p>
<p>As age increases, we discuss how a change in the</p>
<p>dedifferentiation-compensation dynamic will likely trigger an</p>
<p>acceleration in cognitive decline in non-semantic (e.g., language</p>
<p>production) and synergistic tasks (e.g., verbal fluency).</p>
<p>In younger adults, differentiation is implemented by deactivating</p>
<p>provincial nodes within subsystems, which provide segregative properties</p>
<p>to the network (Bertolero et al., 2015; Guimerà &amp; Amaral, 2005). In</p>
<p>contrast, compensatory integration may be implemented by the synergy</p>
<p>between the DMN and FPN regions. Indeed, DMN regions may deactivate</p>
<p>(i.e., satellite-to-peripheral) to offset the integration cost of</p>
<p>long-distance connections in the FPN regions (i.e.,</p>
<p>provincial-to-connector), thus satisfying the principle of economy. It</p>
<p>aligns with numerous studies indicating that the deactivation of DMN</p>
<p>regions via peripheral hubs (Dohmatob et al., 2020) enhances the</p>
<p>coupling of DMN-FPN (Muller et al., 2016; Pistono et al., 2021).</p>
<p>Interestingly, our results suggest that this DMN-FPN coupling may be</p>
<p>disrupted in older adults due to the increased scarcity of satellite</p>
<p>nodes in the associative subsystem (RS NET1). Indeed, satellite nodes</p>
<p>initiate deactivation in the synergistic strategy (i.e.,</p>
<p>satellite-to-peripheral) and enhanced integration in the other strategy</p>
<p>(i.e., satellite-to-connector). Hence, satellite nodes get more scarce</p>
<p>as age increases in RS NET1. Based on our study, we suggest that this</p>
<p>scarcity could change the way compensatory integration is carried out as</p>
<p>age increases. Indeed, DMN regions may shift their connectivity patterns</p>
<p>from deactivation (i.e., satellite-to-peripheral) to integration (i.e.,</p>
<p>satellite-to-connector), favoring the most direct reconfiguration</p>
<p>mechanism which provides an inexpensive way to mitigate cognitive</p>
<p>decline. Interestingly, control-executive regions in older adults may</p>
<p>also switch to this strategy based on short-distance connections (i.e.,</p>
<p>satellite-to-connector) as inter-modular links are no longer</p>
<p>pre-allocated by DMN regions. Nonetheless, the switch of this strategy</p>
<p>in DMN and FPN regions may be less efficient in mitigating cognitive</p>
<p>decline in the long-term due to the instability of short-distance,</p>
<p>intra-modular connections. This is particularly manifest of a greater</p>
<p>dedifferentiated system in older adults and also aligns with a more</p>
<p>inefficient integration of long-distance connections (i.e.,</p>
<p>provincial-to-satellite instead of provincial-to-connector), further</p>
<p>reducing the mitigating effect of integration.</p>
<p>These findings align with a recent study suggesting that a youth-like</p>
<p>network architecture is associated with more economical processing</p>
<p>(Martin et al., 2022). Therefore, our findings (i) supports that an</p>
<p>efficient reorganization most likely follows the principle of economy of</p>
<p>brain network organization, and also (ii) highlight that satellite nodes</p>
<p>may play a pivotal role in this economical reorganization across the</p>
<p>lifespan, responsible for the shift of connectivity patterns of DMN</p>
<p>regions. This aligns with the DECHA model (Default Executive Coupling</p>
<p>Hypothesis of Aging), which reports that older adults with reduced</p>
<p>deactivation in DMN regions fail to modulate control-executive regions</p>
<p>(Spreng &amp; Turner, 2019; Varangis et al., 2019). This also echoes recent</p>
<p>theoretical (Grasso et al., 2021; Varley et al., 2022) and empirical</p>
<p>studies (Luppi et al., 2022; Santos et al., 2023; Varley et al., 2023)</p>
<p>suggesting that higher-order interactions facilitate higher-level</p>
<p>cognitive performances (Williams et al., 2022) such as cognitive control</p>
<p>(Varley et al., 2023), particularly during healthy aging (Gatica et al.,</p>
<p>2021).</p>
<p>*A novel integrative and connectomic model: SENECA*</p>
<p>As Livneh (2023) suggested, we combine the cerebral and cognitive levels</p>
<p>of analysis within a single integrative model: SENECA. The SENECA model</p>
<p>articulates a cerebral (SE) and cognitive (CA) dimension, which embraces</p>
<p>a complex system perspective (NE). We borrow the name from the Seneca</p>
<p>effect, generally found in complex systems, which denotes a slow rise</p>
<p>followed by an abrupt decline (Bardi, 2017). Hereafter, we refer to the</p>
<p>model as SENECA in uppercase and to the Seneca effect in lowercase</p>
<p>letters.</p>
<p>Along the cerebral dimension (SE), we confirm that dedifferentiation and</p>
<p>compensation are two sides of the same coin (Deery et al., 2023; Naik et</p>
<p>al., 2017; Stumme et al., 2020; Tognoli &amp; Kelso, 2014). Specifically, we</p>
<p>show that higher-order interactions between subsystems are the way for</p>
<p>the brain to satisfy the balance between maximal cognitive efficiency</p>
<p>and a minimal cost of integration across the lifespan. In sum, the</p>
<p>synergistic (S) coupling between DMN and FPN regions seems to follow the</p>
<p>principle of the economy (E) of brain network organization (Bullmore &amp;</p>
<p>Sporns, 2012; Martin et al., 2022).</p>
<p>Along the cognitive dimension (CA), we suggest that satellite nodes are</p>
<p>the currency of this economy. Specifically, accelerated cognitive (C)</p>
<p>decline in healthy aging (A) adults may stem from an increased scarcity</p>
<p>of satellite nodes within the language connectome, which disrupts the</p>
<p>way dedifferentiation and compensation are implemented, in turn</p>
<p>disrupting the DMN-FPN coupling that promotes mitigate cognitive decline</p>
<p>mitigation.</p>
<p>Considering both dimensions together, we suggest that the synergistic</p>
<p>(S) and economic (E) reorganization of the language connectome produces</p>
<p>a nonlinear (N) and emerging (E) dynamic of cognitive aging (CA). The</p>
<p>‘nonlinear’ aspect is associated with the acceleration of the cognitive</p>
<p>decline in non-semantic and synergistic tasks, which could mark a</p>
<p>transition in neurocognitive functioning during the fifth decade of</p>
<p>life. The ‘emergent’ aspect suggests that the reorganization at the</p>
<p>subsystem level induces a dynamic at the system level that is more than</p>
<p>the sum of its parts (Pessoa, 2022; Piccinini, 2022). In line with</p>
<p>Stumme et al.&nbsp;(2022), this makes significant progress toward reconciling</p>
<p>cognitive efficiency across topological levels of analysis.</p>
<p>*Perspectives and limitations*</p>
<p>Theoretically, SENECA embraces the notion of cognitomics (Roger et al.,</p>
<p>2018) which proposes to consider the neuropsychological implications</p>
<p>that the connectomic architecture imposes on human cognition and</p>
<p>behavior. Specifically, we provide evidence that changes in the language</p>
<p>architecture mediates cognitive performances supported by intra-</p>
<p>(language) and extra-linguistic sub-processes (long-term memory,</p>
<p>executive functions), as reported conceptually (Hagoort, 2023; Roger,</p>
<p>Banjac, et al., 2022) and empirically (Roger, Rodrigues De Almeida, et</p>
<p>al., 2022). Within this cognitomic perspective, it seems that the</p>
<p>re-allocation of inter- and intra-modular connections between subsystems</p>
<p>provides an appropriate topological framework to investigate the</p>
<p>cognitive efficiency of compensatory integration across the lifespan. In</p>
<p>further studies, we suggest that this framework could serve as the basis</p>
<p>to examine how the mechanisms underlying this</p>
<p>dedifferentiation-compensation dynamic may differ in clinical</p>
<p>populations.</p>
<p>Our study also shows several methodological novelties. First, we propose</p>
<p>a data-driven pipeline that makes extensive use of compositional data</p>
<p>analysis (Greenacre, 2021; Smith et al., 2016) and demonstrate that</p>
<p>isometric log-ratio transformation (ilr) is a valuable tool to model the</p>
<p>dynamic of network communication within and between subsystems. Second,</p>
<p>the data-driven map presented in Figure 5A supports that simple</p>
<p>bivariate correlations are sufficient to identify the amount of</p>
<p>inter-cognitive synergy as a critical determinant of language function.</p>
<p>The map also provides a latent geometry of age-related language</p>
<p>function, which particularly discriminates between key landmarks of</p>
<p>language processing: sentence comprehension (semantic, low synergy),</p>
<p>language production (phonological, mid-low synergy), and semantic</p>
<p>abstraction (semantic, high synergy). This map suggests that topological</p>
<p>roles (Guimerà &amp; Amaral, 2005) provide a parsimonious framework to track</p>
<p>the mechanisms that implement the inter-cognitive synergy and can also</p>
<p>discriminate between critical language tasks. Therefore, rs-LANG may be</p>
<p>appropriate to investigate the age-related variability in language</p>
<p>abilities, despite being based on a task fMRI atlas (Roger, Rodrigues De</p>
<p>Almeida, et al., 2022).</p>
<p>Our study also shows several limitations. Descriptively, the</p>
<p>probabilistic analysis may only model the most potential topological</p>
<p>role for each region and age group. Therefore, it cannot identify all</p>
<p>the regions involved in the underlying mechanisms and fails to account</p>
<p>for inter-individual variability, especially in older adulthood (Stumme</p>
<p>et al., 2020). To clarify, two individuals may have the exact relative</p>
<p>count of connector nodes, but different regions may implement these</p>
<p>roles. To mitigate this issue, we introduced a tolerance parameter in</p>
<p>our analysis for modeling the trajectories with a probability very close</p>
<p>to the top one. Nonetheless, longitudinal studies would be more</p>
<p>appropriate to investigate the reconfiguration between topological</p>
<p>roles.</p>
<p>We considered GAMs for estimating how the system-level dynamic modulates</p>
<p>the mediation effect of topological changes on age-related cognitive</p>
<p>tasks. Although a direct estimation of nonlinear smooth functions within</p>
<p>an ordinary SEM framework would make the causal model more rigorous,</p>
<p>such a framework has yet to be reported in the literature and is likely</p>
<p>to be computationally challenging. Although cross-sectional data may</p>
<p>also bias estimates in mediation analysis (Cole et al., 2013;</p>
<p>Lindenberger et al., 2011), a recent study comparing longitudinal,</p>
<p>cross-sectional, and cohort effects on cognitive aging revealed that</p>
<p>using cross-sectional data is perfectly reasonable as long as no cohort</p>
<p>effect is assumed (Sørensen et al., 2021). In the present study, no</p>
<p>cohort effect is assumed, given that we estimated universal lifespan</p>
<p>trajectories only. Nonetheless, this opens up future perspectives to</p>
<p>investigate how idiosyncratic mechanisms (Baciu et al., 2021) associated</p>
<p>with a high cognitive reserve (Pitarque et al., 2016; Solé-Padullés et</p>
<p>al., 2009) could provide the basis for a more graceful decline as age</p>
<p>advances. Our findings suggest that subcortical structures such as the</p>
<p>bilateral thalamus and putamen could also play a crucial role in these</p>
<p>mechanisms in late adulthood.</p>
<p>Topologically, current methods in graph theory follow the predicate that</p>
<p>inter-regional interactions of interest are limited to dyadic</p>
<p>relationships: two regions connected by an edge (Battiston et al., 2020,</p>
<p>2021). Therefore, graphs need help to fully account for the topological</p>
<p>characteristics intrinsic to higher-level interactions, which cannot</p>
<p>always be modeled as the sum of dyadic interactions. Although dyadic</p>
<p>patterns can often describe the structural architecture, the functional</p>
<p>dynamics underlying complex cognitive functions such as language are</p>
<p>implemented by a distributed network of cortico-subcortical regions and</p>
<p>their multilevel interactions (Gazzaniga et al., 2019; Giusti et al.,</p>
<p>2016) suggesting higher-order coupling. In addition, several studies</p>
<p>have highlighted the redundant nature of specific higher-order motifs</p>
<p>(Merchan &amp; Nemenman, 2016), which can sometimes be fully described in</p>
<p>dyadic relationships. Therefore, modeling higher-level interactions has</p>
<p>a robust statistical (Schneidman et al., 2006; Yu et al., 2011),</p>
<p>topological (Gardner et al., 2021; Giusti et al., 2015), and theoretical</p>
<p>justification for quantifying how the synergy-redundancy balance evolves</p>
<p>across the lifespan to mitigate cognitive decline (Gatica et al., 2021;</p>
<p>Luppi et al., 2022, 2023; Stanford et al., 2022).</p>
<p>Considering the breadth of current neuroimaging datasets, the use of</p>
<p>sophisticated techniques designed to yield high inter- and low</p>
<p>intra-individual variability is timely. The proportional thresholding</p>
<p>for the topological structure (Jiang et al., 2023) may lead to the</p>
<p>exclusion of weaker edges that are neurobiologically meaningful (van</p>
<p>den&nbsp;Heuvel et al., 2017). Therefore, assessing how a data-driven</p>
<p>topological filtering scheme such as OMST (Orthogonal Minimum Spanning</p>
<p>Tree; Dimitriadis et al., 2017; Martin et al., 2022) compares to</p>
<p>proportional thresholding would provide new insight into how older</p>
<p>adults navigate the trade-off between cognitive efficiency and the cost</p>
<p>of synergistic reorganization.</p>
<p># Conclusion</p>
<p>Language is an interactive function that embodies the complexity of</p>
<p>human cognition. In this study, we aimed to clarify how language</p>
<p>function is implemented at the cerebral level across an individual’s</p>
<p>lifespan. We found that synergistic coupling between DMN and FPN regions</p>
<p>may be the way for the brain to maximally mitigate cognitive decline in</p>
<p>language production and verbal fluency while limiting the reorganization</p>
<p>cost. Relatedly, a disruption of this coupling could mark a transition</p>
<p>in neurocognitive functioning towards less synergistic processing around</p>
<p>the fifth decade of life. We summarize these findings in a novel</p>
<p>integrative and connectomic model called SENECA, which articulates a</p>
<p>cerebral (S- synergistic E- economical) and cognitive (C- cognitive A-</p>
<p>aging) dimension within a complex systems perspective (N- nonlinear E-</p>
<p>emergent).</p>

## Software installation

The pipeline revolves around MRtrix3 which works hand in hand with Freesurfer, FSL, and ANTs

1.  Download MRtrix3 by copy pasting this command in a bash terminal

2.  Download Freesurfer by copy pasting this command in a bash terminal

    Make sure to install it into /usr/local

3.  Download FSL

## Preprocessing

## Streamline generation

## Recon-all

This step can be speed up by using gnu parallel : brew install gcc brew install parallel

## Generate Structural connectomes (SC)

## Automation

Download the script below to run the entire pipeline You may have to adapt it to your system specs (# of logical processors available) and to the size of your cohort

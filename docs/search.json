My research project is about modeling how our brain reorganizes across the lifespan to preserve optimal cognitive (language) performances.\nSummary:\nCognitive neuroscience is undergoing a paradigm shift. The abundance of multimodal empirical data, coupled with the unprecendented computational capabilities, is helping to redefine the links between the brain and human behavior. The brain is now understood as a vast network of interactions between cerebral regions from which cognitive operations and processes emerge. Specifically, language functions (L) are not isolated but constantly interact with declarative memory (M) and executive functions (EF). However, the neural mechanisms underlying this L-M-EF dynamic remain unclear. This cognitomic perspective (structure-function-cognition) is closely linked to the identification of multimodal L-M-EF phenotypes, which will enable significant advances in both fundamental and clinical research (e.g. pre-habilitation & cognitive rehabilitation).\nThis project has a theoretical dimension, through the enrichment of a neurocognitive L-M-EF model, and a methodological dimension, through the fusion of multimodal data required to evaluate this model (i.e. structural, functional, cognitive-behavioral: cognitomic)."

### SPM standard pipeline

You can download the batch matlab script [here](https://github.com/ClementGuichet/clementguichet.github.io/blob/main/content/downloads/SPM_Batch_preprocessing.mat). The preprocessing pipeline entails:

-   Realignement & Slice timing

-   Co-registration of the T1w image to the mean image created by the realignement procedure

-   Segmentation

-   Normalization

-   Smoothing (6mm FWHM Gaussian kernel)

### ART

Motion parameters from the realignment are evaluated with ART ([Artifact Detection Tool](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/artifact_detect); Massachusetts Institute of Technology) to detect outlying volumes:

-   Interscan movement threshold of 3 mm in translation, 0.02 rad in rotation

-   Global interscan signal intensity of 3 *SD* relative to the session mean.

-   Individuals with 10% of more outlying volumes can be considered outliers

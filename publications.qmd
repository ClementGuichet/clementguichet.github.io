\# Abstract {#abstract .unnumbered}

Healthy aging is associated with a heterogeneous decline across

cognitive functions, typically observed in language performances.

Examining resting-state fMRI and neuropsychological data from 628

healthy adults (age 18-88) from the CamCAN cohort, we performed

state-of-the-art graph theoretical analysis to uncover the neural

mechanisms underlying this cognitive variability. At the cognitive

level, our findings suggest that language processing is not an isolated

function but is modulated throughout an individual's lifespan by the

extent of inter-cognitive synergy between language, long-term memory,

and executive functions. At the cerebral level, we show that the

coupling between DMN (Default Mode Network) and FPN (Fronto-Parietal

Network) regions may be the way for the brain to compensate for the

effects of dedifferentiation at a minimal cost, efficiently mitigating

the age-related cognitive decline in language production, fluid

processing, and verbal fluency. Notably, the dynamic of cognitive

resilience provided by this synergistic coupling seems to follow the

Seneca effect typically found in complex systems: a slow rise followed

by an abrupt decline. Specifically, we argue that reducing the DMN-FPN

coupling could trigger accelerated cognitive decline around age 50. We

summarize our findings in a novel SENECA model (Synergistic, Economical,

Nonlinear, Emergent, Cognitive Aging), integrating connectomic and

cognitive perspectives within a complex system perspective. Our study

furthers our understanding of the dedifferentiation-compensation

mechanisms that uphold inter-cognitive functioning during healthy aging

and suggests that the fifth decade of life could transition towards less

synergistic processing.

\# Introduction

The crucial need to comprehend the mechanisms that uphold normal

cognitive functioning during aging arises from the significant increase

in the proportion of older individuals (Antoniou & Wright, 2017). A

gradual decline in cognitive abilities typically accompanies aging.

However, this decline is heterogeneous across cognitive functions, and

some of them, such as language, semantic memory, and vocabulary, tend to

be preserved longer (Harada et al., 2013). Therefore, this study aims to

shed light on the neural mechanisms that underpin this variability,

jointly exploring the functional brain architecture and cognitive

performance. Specifically, we hypothesize that changes in language

function across the lifespan are subserved by the reconfiguration of the

language neurocognitive architecture within the framework of an

inter-cognitive interaction between language, long-term memory, and

executive functions.

From a cognitive standpoint, language decline under the effect of age is

not uniform (Baciu et al., 2021). Although overall language performances

tend to be preserved, certain linguistic operations may be impaired with

age (Ramscar et al., 2014; Wlotko et al., 2010). Indeed, while language

comprehension demonstrates higher resilience to the effects of aging

(Diaz et al., 2016; Rossi & Diaz, 2016), language production, which

involves word retrieval and generation (Baciu et al., 2016, 2021), tends

to be more significantly impaired with age (Evrard, 2002; Ramscar et

al., 2014). This is evident in tip-of-the-tongue situations, where

individuals experience a feeling of knowing the meaning of a word but

struggle to immediately recall and produce the word form (Burke et al.,

1991; Condret-Santi et al., 2013). This discrepancy between

comprehension and production can be attributed to the advantages of

semantic context and the accumulation of verbal knowledge throughout the

lifespan (Deary et al., 2009).

From a cerebral standpoint, brain networks may interact with one

another, reflecting how language adapts to socio-communicative contexts

by drawing memories, knowledge, and beliefs from long-term memory (Duff

& Brown-Schmidt, 2012; Horton, 2007) under the control of executive

functions (Corballis, 2019; Hertrich et al., 2020). While long-term

memory provides 'traffic' content and coherency, executive functioning

provides flexibility and coordination to focus, plan, accomplish tasks,

and control emotions. In a previous teamwork (Roger, Banjac, et al.,

2022), our team proposed a theoretical framework that conceptualizes the

inter-cognitive synergy between language, long-term memory, and

executive functions at the cognitive level, L∪M (i.e.,

Language/union/Memory), and suggested that functional connectivity-based

interactions may implement this synergy at the neural level.

Indeed, based on a data-driven approach, the language neurocognitive

architecture based on extrinsic brain activity (Roger, Rodrigues De

Almeida, et al., 2022) has been highlighted as a language connectome

comprising four non-overlapping subsystems, each probabilistically

mapping onto known resting-state brain networks (i.e., RSNs; Ji et al.,

2019): core Language (Net1), Control-Executive (Net2), Conceptual

(Net3), and Sensorimotor (Net4). Interestingly, these findings indicate

that age-related decline in language production impacts the

extra-linguistic components (Net2 and Net3) beyond the typical core

language network (Hertrich et al., 2020). This suggests that language

performances in older adults could be determined by synergistic

processing (Gatica et al., 2021) or higher-order connectivity-based

interactions between regions that support control-executive and

conceptual processes. In light of the effect that the reconfiguration of

the language connectome has on language function, our team also proposed

adopting a 'cognitomic' perspective (Roger et al., 2018), which

emphasizes the neuropsychological implications that this connectomic

architecture has across the lifespan.

Within this cognitomic perspective, graph theory (Bullmore & Sporns,

2009; Bullmore & Bassett, 2011; Rubinov & Sporns, 2010) is appropriate

to identify the neural substrates of this inter-cognitive synergy.

Specifically, the brain network can be characterized in terms of

integration and segregation properties (Cohen & D'Esposito, 2016; Genon

et al., 2018) at different topological levels (i.e.,

whole-brain/system-level, modular/subsystem-level, and

region/nodal-level) (Farahani et al., 2019; Fornito et al., 2016).

Across the lifespan, cognitive efficiency is supported by a balance

between integrated and modular information processing (Bullmore &

Sporns, 2012; Meunier et al., 2010; van den Heuvel & Sporns, 2013). In

other words, optimal coordination of neural activity is based on the

homeostasis between integration and segregation properties (Cole et al.,

2013; Fornito et al., 2015).

In line with our previous findings (Roger, Rodrigues De Almeida, et al.,

2022), a recent systematic review of resting-state data studies reported

that reduced local efficiency at the system level, along with reduced

segregation and enhanced integration within and between RSNs at the

subsystem level, are the connectomic fingerprints of healthy aging with

an inflection point around the fifth decade of life (Deery et al.,

2023). However, a crucial challenge resides in understanding the

mechanisms that bridge reduced segregation with enhanced integration

(Stumme et al., 2020) and how these changes induce a dynamic at the

system level associated with cognitive performance as age advances.

Indeed, studies report contradictory findings depending on the

topological level of analysis. At the system level, age-related enhanced

integration (Battaglia et al., 2020) is generally associated with a

dedifferentiated system that fails to alternate efficiently between

integrative and segregative states of connectivity (Chan et al., 2014;

Chan et al., 2017). At a subsystem level, brain regions undergo a

similar dedifferentiation process associated with a loss in function

specialization (Goh et al., 2010; Park et al., 2004). This is primarily

reflected by reduced segregation and enhanced integration in the

sensorimotor and higher-order executive networks (Deery et al., 2023;

Wig, 2017). However, in contrast with the system level, enhanced

integration has been shown to be compensatory (Cabeza et al., 2018) with

direct benefits on preserving cognitive performances (Bertolero et al.,

2015; Meunier et al., 2010). Specifically, increased coupling between

DMN and control-executive regions across subnetworks has also been

linked with better global cognitive performances (Spreng et al., 2018;

Spreng & Turner, 2019). Specifically, it appears that the deactivation

of DMN regions may be a key ingredient of cognitive resilience across

the lifespan or the capacity to mitigate the deleterious effect of

dedifferentiation (Deery et al., 2023; Grady et al., 2016; Singh-Manoux

et al., 2012; Varangis et al., 2019). Indeed, failing to deactivate the

DMN subnetwork seems to worsen performance in synergistic cognitive

functions, based on intra-linguistic and control-executive processes,

such as verbal fluency (Muller et al., 2016; Whiteside et al., 2016).

Overall, the main objective of this study is to investigate how the

reorganization of the language connectome relates to the variability of

cognitive performances across the lifespan. By assuming that language is

a complex function in synergy with long-term memory and executive

functions, we aimed to model how changes in the neural mechanisms that

support this inter-cognitive synergy underlie this variability. To

address this objective, we leveraged a population-based resting state

fMRI dataset from the CamCAN cohort (Cam-CAN et al., 2014) and applied

graph theoretical analyses to evaluate the reorganization of the

language connectome in terms of segregation and integration properties

at multiple topological scales of analysis.

\# Materials & Methods

\## Participants

We included 652 healthy adults from the Cambridge Center for Ageing and

Neuroscience project cohort (Cam-CAN et al., 2014). Further recruitment

information can be found in Taylor et al. (2017). Our analysis focused

exclusively on functional fMRI brain data obtained during a resting

state period. After careful examination, we had a final sample size of

628 participants (age range: 18-88; 320 females; 208 males). Several

participants were excluded from the analysis for various reasons,

including missing functional imaging data (N = 4), incomplete volume

acquisition (N = 4; one subject was retained with 74% of the total

number of volumes), unreliable CSF mask (N = 9), and having 10% or more

outlying volumes after preprocessing (M = 13.6, SD = 3.2, N = 8). Then,

we chose eight cognitive tasks to span a continuous spectrum from a high

to a low degree of synergy between language, long-term memory, and

executive functions (Table 1). Consequently, the dataset was further

reduced to 613 participants to analyze the relationship between brain

activity and cognition. Specifically, we excluded participants with more

than 3 missing neuropsychological scores and replaced the latter with

the appropriate median of the age decile for the remaining participants.

\## MR acquisition

For information regarding the MR acquisition and the resting state

protocol applied in this study, please refer to Cam-CAN et al. (2014),

as the data was sourced from the Cambridge Center for Ageing and

Neuroscience project cohort.

\## Resting-state fMRI data analysis

\### Data Preprocessing

The rs-fMRI data underwent preprocessing using SPM12 (Welcome Department

of Imaging Neuroscience, UK, \<http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/\>) within

MATLAB R2020b (MathWorks Inc., Sherborn, MA, USA). We employed a

standard preprocessing pipeline (including realignment, reslicing,

co-registration, segmentation, normalization, and smoothing) similar to

that described in our previous work (see Roger et al., 2020) with

specific details mentioned in Appendix S1.

\### Cerebral parcellation: the LANG connectome atlas

The LANG connectome atlas, referred to as the LANG atlas, comprises a

collection of 131 regions of interest (ROI) derived from a panel of 13

language fMRI tasks (see Roger, Rodrigues De Almeida, et al., 2022).

Each ROI is represented by a spherical region with a diameter of 6 mm,

centered on the MNI coordinates as proposed by Power et al. (2011). To

transform the LANG atlas, which is based on extrinsic fMRI activation,

into a resting-state LANG (rs-LANG) atlas consisting of ROIs derived

from the intrinsic activity, we labeled all LANG regions according to

their primary resting-state network (RSN) based on the Cole-Anticevic

Brainwide Net Partition (CAB-NP; Ji et al., 2019). We utilized a

publicly available volumetric version of the CAB-NP that was converted

to standard MNI space. By overlaying the volumetric RSN map onto the 131

regions (see Banjac et al., 2021), we determined the number of voxels

that overlapped between each region and each RSN. This approach ensured

accurate voxel-based labeling of each region to their primary RSN.

During the examination of the modular organization of rs-LANG (see

Figure 2), the RSN composition of a given subsystem was weighted by the

mean percentage of overlap between the primary RSN and each region of

the identified subsystem. This improvement led to a 12% increase in mean

accuracy.

\### Resting-state LANG connectomes

Using the CONN toolbox (Behzadi et al., 2007), we conducted an

ROI-to-ROI analysis and generated a connectivity matrix of dimensions

131x131 for each participant. These connectivity matrices were

subsequently employed for network analysis. We disregarded negative

correlations by setting them to zero, consistent with previous studies

(Chong et al., 2019; Martin et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2011).

Additionally, we applied thresholding to each matrix at five sparsity

levels (10, 12, 15, 17, and 20%). This step aimed to reduce the presence

of spurious connections and was based on the most likely sparsity levels

known to produce a small-world organization, as outlined by Achard and

Bullmore (2007). Subsequently, the thresholded matrices were binarized

to generate five undirected graphs for each participant.

\## Resting state LANG network analysis

The network analysis, or graph analysis, was employed to measure

information flow within each connectome (Rubinov & Sporns, 2010).

Specifically, we assessed (i) the balance between functional integration

and segregation at the system level, (ii) the modularity at the

subsystem level, and (iii) the information transfer at the nodal level

by evaluating the topological role of each region.

\### System-level analysis: integration vs. segregation balance assessment

Using the Brain Connectivity Toolbox (BCT) implemented in MATLAB 2020b

and available at \<https://www.nitrc.org/projects/bct/\> (Bullmore &

Sporns, 2009), we extracted three key graph metrics: (1) global

efficiency (Eglob), (2) local efficiency (Eloc), and (3) clustering

coefficient (Clustcoeff). Globally, Eglob was calculated as the inverse

of the shortest path lengths or the average of unweighted efficiencies

across all pairs of nodes (Latora & Marchiori, 2001). This metric

quantifies the efficiency of parallel information transmission across

the global network (Bullmore & Bassett, 2011). Locally, Eloc is similar

to Eglob but on node neighborhoods. When averaged at the system level,

it illustrates the segregation property of a network for processing

information (Latora & Marchiori, 2001). For each node, the clustering

coefficient (Clustcoeff) was calculated as the fraction of a node's

neighbors that are also neighbors of each other (Rubinov & Sporns, 2010)

and averaged at the system level. We visually inspected Eglob and

Clustcoeff across the five sparsity levels and determined that the

optimal threshold that balances integrated and modular processing was

15% (Figure S2, Appendix S2). We further ensured that this threshold was

optimal by repeating the procedure for each age decile. Following this,

we reduced all graphs to a fixed number of edges by retaining the top

15% (2554 edges). Additionally, we verified that the reduced connectomes

maintained full connectivity and sufficiently devoided of isolated

nodes, meaning that the largest connected component (LCC) included at

least 80% of all nodes. After thresholding at 15%, we characterized the

balance between functional integration and segregation at the system

level by determining the relative predominance of global (Eglob) versus

local efficiency (Eloc). A higher balance reflects a higher predominance

of integration or higher integrative/global efficiency.

\$\$System - level\\ balance\\ (integration\\ vs.\\ segregation)\\ = \\frac{E\_{glob}{- \\ E}\_{loc}}{E\_{glob} + E\_{loc}}\$\$

\### Subsystem-level analysis: modularity assessment

To examine the modular organization of rs-LANG, we employed the Louvain

community detection algorithm (Blondel et al., 2008) with a resolution

parameter set to γ = 1.295, aiming to align with the RSNs identified in

the CAB-NP Atlas (Ji et al., 2019). As different runs of the algorithm

can yield varying optimal partitions, we implemented a consensus

clustering approach (Lancichinetti & Fortunato, 2012). This approach

involves iteratively clustering co-assignment matrices until

convergence, aggregating the frequency of node assignments to the same

module. To reduce spurious node assignments, we applied a threshold of τ

= 0.5 to the co-assignment matrices (Jiang et al., 2021). If a node did

not consistently belong to the same module in at least 50% of the

iterations, its co-assignment weight was set to zero. We executed the

algorithm 1000 times for each subject and repeated the entire process

1000 times to generate a group-level consensus partition based on the

subject-level partitions. We ensured that this consensus partition

accurately represented all individuals across different ages, confirming

its suitability for statistical analysis (refer to Appendix S1 for

further information).

\### Nodal-level analysis: topological roles

At the nodal level, we investigated the topological reorganization of

each connectome by defining four distinct topological roles: Connector,

Provincial, Satellite, and Peripheral (Bertolero et al., 2015; Guimerà &

Amaral, 2005). Therefore, the composition of each individual's language

connectome is represented by four percentages which add up to 100%. To

assign each role to a node (i.e., a region), we employed two graph

metrics, (i) the Within-Module Z-score (WMZ; Latora & Marchiori, 2001),

which quantifies connectivity within subsystems (intra-modular), and

\(ii\) the normalized Participation Coefficient (PC; Pedersen et al.,

2019\) which measures connectivity between subsystems (inter-modular)

while removing the bias associated with the number of nodes in each

module. Consistent with prior research (Roger, Rodrigues De Almeida, et

al., 2022; Schedlbauer & Ekstrom, 2019), we standardized both metrics

(WMZ and zPCnorm) for each individual and assigned a topological role to

each node. In relation to the entire set of 131 regions, a Connector

node displays a high proportion of both intra- and inter-modular

connections (zPCnorm \\\>= 0, WMZ \\\>= 1e-5). A Provincial node displays a

high proportion of intra-modular connections (zPCnorm \\\< 0, WMD \\\>=

1e-5). A Satellite node displays a high proportion of inter-modular

connections (zPCnorm \\\>= 0, WMZ \\\< 1e-5). A Peripheral node, on the

other hand, displays a low proportion of all modular connections

(zPCnorm \\\< 0, WMZ \\\< 1e-5).

\## Statistics

We conducted statistical analysis along four steps. Figure 1 illustrates

the analytical pipeline. First, we examined the evolution in the

proportion of topological roles across the lifespan using compositional

analysis techniques (Greenacre, 2021). Second, we modeled the neural

mechanisms that drive this evolution using probabilities. This allowed

us to uncover the patterns and principles governing the connectivity

changes in the language connectome across the lifespan. Third, we

employed a canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to examine the

many-to-many relationships between these neural mechanisms and the

changes in cognitive performances across the lifespan. Finally, CCA

analysis helped specify a causal model of how changes in the topological

properties of the language connectome, at the system and subsystem

levels, may explain the variability in age-related cognitive

performances.

\*\*Figure 1.\*\* Illustration of the analysis pipeline

\### Compositional analysis of the language connectome

Due to the high correlation among components and the dependence on

pairwise covariance (Greenacre, 2021; Smith et al., 2016), the relative

count of topological roles was unsuitable for direct statistical

analysis. To address this issue, we used a log-based transformation that

mapped these counts to Euclidean space (i.e., isometric log-ratios

(ilr); Egozcue, 2003) (refer to Appendix S1 for more details). This

transformation allowed us to construct four log-contrasts, referred to

as compositional balances in our study, to capture the dynamics of each

role across the lifespan, specifically Connector, Provincial,

Peripheral, and Satellite (Eq. 1). To enhance the interpretability of

these log-contrasts and address potential issues regarding causality

(Ailer et al., 2021), we incorporated the count of all topological roles

into the equation. This ensured that an increase in the Connector

balance was necessarily driven by an increase in the absolute count of

connector nodes. Hereafter Eq.1 describes the compositional balances.

\$\$\\mathbf{Connector\\ balance = \\ }\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}}\\ \\ln\\left( \\frac{Connector}{(Provincial \\times Peripheral \\times Satellite)\^{\\frac{1}{3}}} \\right)\$\$

\$\${\\mathbf{Provincial}\\ \\mathbf{balance} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}}\\ \\ln\\left( \\frac{Provincial}{(Connector \\times Peripheral \\times Satellite)\^{\\frac{1}{3}}} \\right)

}{\\mathbf{Peripheral\\ balance}\\ = \\ \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}}\\ \\ln\\left( \\frac{Peripheral}{(Connector \\times Provincial \\times Satellite)\^{\\frac{1}{3}}} \\right)}\$\$

\$\$\\mathbf{Satellite\\ balance}\\ = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}}\\ \\ln\\left( \\frac{Satellite}{(Connector \\times Provincial \\times Peripheral)\^{\\frac{1}{3}}} \\right)\$\$

Subsequently, for each compositional balance, we used generalized

additive models (GAM) with factor-smooth interactions to track the

evolution in the proportion of each topological role across the lifespan

within each subsystem of the resting-state language connectome (rs-LANG)

(Wood, 2006); mgcv package in R, Wood, 2017). For additional information

and specifics, please refer to Appendix S1.

\### Probabilistic analysis of the neural mechanisms

To elucidate the neural mechanisms driving the evolution of the

proportion of topological roles (section 2.5.1), we modeled the

probability that each region changes its topological role across the

lifespan. Based on the compositional results (section 3.2), we

determined the most probable role of each region within three distinct

age groups: a younger group (18-45 excluded), a middle-aged group (45-55

included), and an older group (\\\>55). Concretely, we first calculated

the probabilities for all pairwise trajectories between the younger and

middle-aged groups and then repeated the calculation between the

resulting non-zero trajectories and the older age group. To account for

the inter-individual variability within each age group, we considered

all the trajectories whose probability fell within a 5% range from the

highest probability for each region. Using this approach, we captured

for each region the most likely transitions of topological roles between

age groups while considering the variability within each age group.

\### Canonical correlation analysis

To identify the many-to-many relationships between subsystem-level

balances (brain set) and neuropsychological scores (cognitive set), we

conducted a canonical correlation analysis (CCA). CCA works by finding

the linear combinations within the brain and cognitive set of variables

that maximize the correlation between the two sets (Wang et al., 2020).

The analysis produces a number of canonical functions equal to the

number of variables within the smaller set (viz., eight functions for

the eight variables of the cognitive set). Each canonical function is

composed of two variates: a latent brain and cognitive variable (Sherry

& Henson, 2005). To address the issue of multicollinearity among brain

variables inherent to compositional data, we ran two CCA models: one

excluding the Satellite balances and the other excluding the Peripheral

balances of each subsystem. Both CCA models yielded identical structure

coefficients (\$r\_{s}\$), representing the correlations between the

observed variables and the variates and identical latent coordinates for

the variates, although with different linear combinations (\*b;\* function

coefficients). This approach allowed us to construct a latent

correlational space based on the cognitive variate-cognitive variable

and cognitive variate-brain variable correlations.

\### Causal analysis

Based on the results from the CCA analysis, we proposed a causal model

that integrates age (X), cognitive performance (Y), subsystem

reconfiguration of the resting-state language connectome, as measured by

the compositional balances (M), and the balance between integration and

segregation properties at the system level (W). Using the lavaan package

in R (Rosseel, 2012), we examined how a higher integrative efficiency

\(W\) may mitigate cognitive decline by reducing the mediation effect (X

-\\\> M -\\\> Y). To achieve this, we tested for indirect path moderation

using an index of moderated mediation and a simple slope analysis should

the index be significant (Hayes, 2018). For more details, please refer

to Appendix S1.

\## Modular organization of the Language connectome at rest (rs-LANG)

Applying modularity analysis to the resting-state Language connectome

(rs-LANG) uncovered four main subsystems. Figure 2 provides a visual

representation of these subsystems. Appendix S2 provides a detailed

comparison with the task-based modular organization of the same

connectome, described by Roger, Rodrigues De Almeida, et al. (2022).

Considering the composition, the largest subsystem, RS NET1 (40

regions), is composed of 66.4% of DMN regions known to be involved in

higher-level cognitive function and can thus be regarded as the

associative subsystem. The second largest subsystem, RS NET2 (34

regions), is saturated by sensorimotor regions (SMN; 77.1%) along with

contributions from CON regions (15.3%) and can thus be regarded as the

sensorimotor subsystem. The third largest subsystem, RS NET3 (32

regions), engages the cingulo-opercular network (CON; 56.4%), a broader

network encompassing the salience network (SAL) and known to support

low-level attentional redirection. It can thus be regarded as the

low-level attentional subsystem. The smallest subsystem, RS NET4 (22

regions), is saturated by FPN regions (63.1%), with nontrivial

contributions from CON regions as well (17.2%), and can thus be regarded

as the control-executive subsystem. In addition, RS NET1 & 3 are

supported by FPN regions (13.8% & 11.8%), and RS NET1, 3, and 4 by

Language regions (13%, 10.8%, 8.6%).

\## Compositional analysis of the language connectome

Overall, we found that healthy aging is associated with reduced local

efficiency (\*t\* = -10.37, p \\\< .001, \$\\eta\_{2p}\$ = .15, 95% CI \\\[.11;

Inf\\\]) and preserved global efficiency (\*t\* = -1.14, p = .26), which

tilts the balance between integration and segregation towards a higher

integrative efficiency as age increases (\*t\* = 9.71, p \\\< .001,

\$\\eta\_{2p}\$ = .13, 95% CI \\\[.09; Inf\\\]) (see Figure 3A).

Considering the evolution of topological roles (Figure 3B), we found

that healthy aging is associated with a decrease in the proportion of

provincial nodes (\*b\* = -0.07 95% CI \\\[-0.09; -0.05\\\]; F(1, 624) = 52.5;

p \\\< .001; \$\\eta\_{p}\^{2}\$ = .08) and satellite nodes (\*b\* = -0.03 95% CI

\\\[-0.04; -0.01\\\]; F(1, 624) = 20.3; p \\\< .001; \$\\eta\_{p}\^{2}\$ = .03),

which is contrasted by an increase in the proportion of connector nodes

(\*b\* = 0.04 95% CI \\\[0.02; 0.05\\\]; F(1, 624) = 31.5; p \\\< .001;

\$\\eta\_{p}\^{2}\$ = .05) and peripheral nodes (\*b\* = 0.04 95% CI \\\[0.02;

0.05\\\]; F(1, 624) = 25.6; p \\\< .001; \$\\eta\_{p}\^{2}\$ = .04).

Considering the significant changes at the subsystem level (Figure 3C),

we found that, in RS NET4, the rate of loss of provincial nodes (F =

29.8, p \\\< .001, \*edf\* = 1), the rate of gain of connector nodes (F =

13.6, p \\\< .001, \*edf\* = 1) and peripheral nodes (F = 6.5, p = .02,

\*edf\* = 1) remains constant across the lifespan, while the loss of

satellite nodes stabilizes around age 50 (F = 5.1, p = .007, \*edf\* =

2.1). Interestingly, in RS NET1, we observed a dynamic of

reconfiguration centered around this age window: while the rate of loss

of satellite nodes remains constant (F = 15.5, p \\\< .001, \*edf\* = 1),

the rate of gain of peripheral nodes in RS NET1 (F = 6.7, p = .001,

\*edf\* = 2.27) gets slower and the rate of gain of connector nodes tends

to accelerate (F = 2, p = .18, \*edf\* = 2.37). In contrast, while the

rate of loss of provincial nodes being quite constant (F = 6.8, p = .01,

\*edf\* = 1.31), the rate of gain of connector nodes (F = 3.81, p = .034,

\*edf\* = 2.23) slows down but that of peripheral nodes tends to

accelerate (F = 1.9, p = .17, \*edf\* = 2.42). Overall, this suggests

that, around age 50, RS NET4 stops losing satellite nodes and that

changes in the connectivity patterns of RS NET1 and 2 are mirrored.

\## Probabilistic analysis of the neural mechanisms

Probabilistic analysis revealed that 35.8% of the language connectome

(47 regions) undergoes a topological reorganization across the lifespan.

Across subsystems, 50% of RS NET4, 50% of RS NET2, and 34% of RS NET1

regions reconfigure, whereas regions in RS NET3 are more inflexible

(24.3%). A web app is available to explore the reconfiguration

cross-sectionally: \<https://lpnc-lang.shinyapps.io/seneca/\>. To account

for inter-individual variability, we consider 16 additional

trajectories, which are also highly probable (see section 2.5.2 for

details on the calculations), which amounts to 63 trajectories in total

and is the number of references for the results below.

As suggested by compositional analysis, we found that functional

integration, via the gain of connector nodes, is driven by the

reconfiguration of provincial and satellite nodes.

Considering provincial nodes, the decrease is mostly due to the

acquisition of new between-subsystem connections or inter-modular links

(i.e., provincial-to-connector; 30.1% of all reconfigurations), 52.6%

before and 47.4% after age 45-55. Specifically, we notice that RS NET4,

which accounts for 31.5% of these acquisitions, tends to acquire them

before age 45-55 (83.3%), whereas RS NET2, which accounts for 57.8% of

these acquisitions, continues to acquire them after age 45-55 (63.6%).

In addition, we notice that the number of regions failing to acquire

these properties doubles across the lifespan for RS NET4 (i.e.,

provincial-to-satellite reconfigurations instead of

provincial-to-connector) and starts appearing in RS NET1. This

highlights the greater instability of intra-modular links after age

45-55 in RS NET1 & 4.

Interestingly, we observed that this dynamic correlates a change in the

way reduced segregation is conducted across the lifespan (i.e.,

provincial-to-peripheral; 9.5% of all reconfigurations). Indeed, reduced

segregation is dominated by RS NET1 (right MTG; 92% FPN, right BA44; 72%

DMN) and complemented by RS NET4 (left IFG; 99% FPN) before age 45-55,

and after age 45-55 is dominated by RS NET2 (right SMA; SMN, left

paracentral lobule; 74% DMN) and complemented by RS NET1 (left insula;

72% DMN).

Considering satellite nodes, we found the opposite pattern. The decrease

is mostly due to the acquisition of new within-subsystem connections or

intra-modular links (i.e., satellite-to-connector; 20.6% of all

reconfigurations), 69.2% of which occur after age 45-55. Specifically,

RS NET3 and RS NET4, which respectively account for 38.4% and 15.3% of

these acquisitions, tend to acquire them after age 45-55 (80% and 100%),

whereas RS NET2 and 1, which respectively accounts for 30.7%, and 15.3%

of these acquisitions, tends to acquire them in equal proportions across

the lifespan. In addition, we notice that this acquisition may be

inefficient after age 45-55, given the opposite connector-to-satellite

reconfigurations in RS NET1, 2, and 4 (8% of all reconfigurations).

Interestingly, we observed that this dynamic correlates with a change in

the way deactivation is conducted across the lifespan (i.e.,

satellite-to-peripheral; 9.5% of all reconfigurations). Indeed, this

mechanism occurs exclusively before age 45-55 (5 out of 6 trajectories:

83.3%; 1 out of 6 being in RS NET4) and is most likely to be implemented

by RS NET1 (left fusiform area; 63% DAN, 37% DMN; left paracentral

lobule; 93% DMN; left pCC 68% DMN) as well as in bilateral postcentral

regions in RS NET3 (95% SMN).

To summarize, probabilistic analysis helps us clarify the dynamic of

reconfiguration of the language connectome across the lifespan based on

the reallocation of inter- and intra-modular links. As illustrated in

Figure 4, this suggests two strategies for acquiring connector

properties across the lifespan: (i) an efficient, synergistic strategy

based on inter-modular links and the coupling between RS NET1 and RS

NET4, which is implemented before age 45-55; (ii) an inefficient

strategy based on intra-modular links, which occurs primarily in older

adults. The detail of the regions involved in all mechanisms can be

found in Appendix S3.

(inter-links) and the coupling between DMN and FPN regions which is most

efficient in younger adults. (ii) an inexpensive strategy based on links

within subsystems (intra-links) which occurs primarily in older adults

\## Canonical correlation analysis

Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) yielded two significant canonical

functions, each composed of a cognitive and brain variate, which

maximize the correlation between the brain and cognitive set of

variables (\$R\_{c1}\$ = .28; \$R\_{c1}²\$ = 8%, p \\\< .001; \$R\_{c1}\$ = .25;

\$R\_{c2}²\$ = 6%, p \\\< .001). We examine these results in two steps. In

the first step, we analyze the organization of the age-related

performances in the eight cognitive tasks based on the two cognitive

variates (section 3.1.1.). In the second step, we identify the brain

variables associated with this organization (section 3.1.2.).

\### Effect of age on cognitive functions

Based on the correlations between the two cognitive variates and each

cognitive variable (i.e., structure coefficients; \$r\_{s\\ }\$), we built

the corresponding cognitive map shown in Figure 5A. By relating the

age-related performances of the eight cognitive tasks (Figure 5C, Table

2\) with the cognitive map, we found that cognitive decline can be

predicted by two factors.

\*\*Table 2.\*\* Estimates from generalized additive models (GAMs):

Cognitive variable \*\*\\\~\*\* s(Age). All models are significant at p \\\<

.001 '\\\*\\\*\\\*'. Deviance explained is used as a proxy for the amount of

age-related cognitive decline

The first factor may correspond to the amount of semantic processing

associated with a task. Given the high correlation between the deviance

reported in Table 2 (r = -.94, p \\\< .001) and the coordinates of

cognitive tasks on this factor, we suggest that semantic processing is

the main predictor of age-related cognitive performances. In other

words, the first factor discriminates non-semantic tasks, which tend to

decline the most (fluid processing: r\~\\\_Cattell\~ = -.8; phonological

access: r\~\\\_Naming\~ = -.78) from semantic tasks which tend to decline

the least (semantic access: r\~\\\_Comprehension\~ = -.27; lexical

retrieval: r\~\\\_ToT\~ = -.26; semantic abstraction: r\~\\\_Proverb\~ = .06).

Based on the description of the processes recruited for each cognitive

task (see Table 1, section 2.1), the second factor may correspond to the

amount of synergy between language, long-term memory, and executive

functions associated with a task. Interestingly, synergistic task

performances have a nonlinear relationship with age. Indeed, Figure 5B

illustrates a shift around age 50 from an increase to a decrease in

performance (F = 5.6, p \\\< .001, \*edf\* = 2.7). Therefore, this second

factor may discriminate the highly synergistic tasks which follow this

shift (r\~\\\_Proverb\~ = -.68, r\~\\\_Multitasking\~ = -.59,

r\~\\\_Verbal_Fluency\~ = -.53) from the less synergistic tasks which do not

(r\~\\\_Comprehension\~ = -.04, r\~\\\_LTM\~ = -.07, and r\~\\\_Cattell\~ = -.08).

In addition, this decrease in synergistic task performances is

associated with accelerated cognitive decline in non-semantic tasks

around the same age window (F = 119, p \\\< .001, \*edf\* = 4.9; Figure 5B).

age 50. Panel C. Age-related performances of the eight cognitive tasks

\### Effect of age on cognitive functions and cerebral correlates

We identified the brain variables that correlate with the task

performances of the first cognitive variate, which is the variate that

combines the factors identified in the previous section. As illustrated

by the grey trajectory in Figure 5A, a high correlation with the first

cognitive variate (e.g., r\~\\\_Naming\~ = -.7, r\~\\\_Cattell\~ = -.63,

r\~\\\_Verbal_Fluency\~ = -.62) suggests that performances tend to increase

before accelerating around age 50-55. Therefore, the brain changes that

are also highly correlated with this variate may be associated with this

dynamic.

Below, we only considered the brain variables that showed a significant

or tendency for change across the lifespan (see section 3.2). In line

with probabilistic analysis (section 3.3), Figure 6 illustrates that the

dynamic of the first cognitive variate is primarily associated with

provincial-to-connector reconfigurations in RS NET4 and

satellite-to-peripheral reconfigurations in RS NET1. This further

suggests that a coupling between deactivation in RS NET1 and integration

in RS NET4 is responsible for cognitive performance variations across

the lifespan. Moreover, Figure 6 suggests that the shift around age 50

in the performances of synergistic tasks driven by a shift in the

connectivity patterns in RS NET1 from deactivation towards integration.

This particularly highlights the pivotal role of satellite nodes, as

previously identified in Figure 4 (section 3.3).

aging. Coordinates represent the correlations between topological

changes in the language connectome and the cognitive variates (i.e.,

cross-loadings). The shift around age 50 corresponds to a shift from

deactivation to integration of DMN regions which disrupts the DMN-FPN

coupling that mitigates cognitive decline. The black box in the bottom

left can be viewed in full size in Figure 5A

\## Causal analysis

Based on the results of canonical correlation analysis, we hypothesized

that the synergy between deactivation in RS NET1 and integration in RS

NET4 may mitigate cognitive decline before age 50, whereas a loss of

this coupling may accelerate cognitive decline after age 50. Therefore,

we examined whether the reorganization at the subsystem level, which we

described in the previous section, induces a high integrative efficiency

at the system level (balance integration/segregation) to mitigate this

decline (see Figure S4, Appendix S2 for an illustration of the model).

As expected, at the subsystem level, we found that the reorganization of

the language connectome (i.e., less provincial nodes in RS NET4 and 2

and more connector nodes in RS NET4 coupled with more peripheral nodes

in RS NET1) mediates cognitive decline (mediation (a\\\*b1): \*z\* = 3.672,

p \\\< .001) in non-semantic or highly synergistic tasks (r\\\_\~Naming\~ =

-.69, r\\\_\~Cattell\~ = -.63, r\\\_\~Verbal_Fluency\~ = -.62, r\\\_\~Multitasking\~

= -.55, r\\\_\~Proverb\~ = -.43). Nonetheless, it seems that this

reorganization also induces a high integrative efficiency at the system

level (a\\\*d1: \*z\* = -2.21, p = .003) which partially mitigates this

decline (moderated mediation (a\\\*b2): \*z\* = -2.2, p = .03). Indeed,

Figure 7 clarifies that a high integrative efficiency gradually

mitigates cognitive decline until a tipping point around age 54 (Figure

7; full tensor product: \*edf\* = 7.377, F = 50.1, p \\\< .001). line with

our previous analyses, this could suggest a sudden loss in synergistic

processing \![\](media/image8.png){width="5.7659722222222225in"

subsystem level (M), and the balance between integration and segregation

\# Discussion

Healthy aging is associated with a heterogeneous decline across

cognitive functions, including language. However, the neural mechanisms

underlying this variability still need to be understood. In this study,

we leveraged resting-state fMRI and neuropsychological data from the

population-based CamCAN cohort (Cam-CAN et al., 2014) to investigate the

functional reorganization of the language connectome and its association

with age-related cognitive variability. Employing state-of-the-art graph

theoretical analysis, we developed a data-driven pipeline that

integrates both cerebral and cognitive levels of analysis.

Our findings can be summarized in two categories, shedding light on the

mechanisms that underlie the evolution of neurocognitive functioning

across the lifespan. First, at the cognitive level, we demonstrate that

language processing is not an isolated function but is modulated

throughout an individual's lifespan by the extent of inter-cognitive

synergy between language, long-term memory, and executive functions.

This modulation offers a potential explanation for the observed

variability in language performances. Second, at the cerebral level, we

reveal that the synergistic coupling between DMN and FPN regions may act

as a compensatory mechanism to mitigate the loss in the specialization.

Importantly, we propose that a loss in this synergistic processing

around the fifth decade of life may trigger a transition in

neurocognitive functioning associated with accelerated cognitive

decline.

Taken together, the present study contributes to ground neurocognitive

aging as the study of a dynamical system which provides the basis for

'studying the emergent function and its efficiency' (Naik et al., 2017;

O'Byrne & Jerbi, 2022). Our findings can be formalized as a novel SENECA

model (Synergistic, Economical, Nonlinear, Emergent, Cognitive Aging),

integrating connectomic and cognitive dimensions within a complex system

perspective. SENECA furthers our understanding of the brain's language

processes and their implication on inter-cognitive functioning in

healthy aging.

\*Evidence for inter-cognitive functioning across the lifespan\*

At a cognitive level, our results from canonical correlation analysis

(section 3.4) offer a new quantitative framework that emphasizes the

implication of synergistic processing on age-related variability in

language abilities (Gatica et al., 2021; Muller et al., 2016).

Indeed, we found that cognitive performances in healthy adults are

primarily influenced by the amount of semantic processing demanded by a

task. However, we also observed a dynamic interplay between language and

executive functions, suggesting that the amount of inter-cognitive

synergy could modulate the effect of semantic processing on age-related

cognitive decline. Indeed, our findings also suggest that a sudden shift

around age 50 from better to worse performances in synergistic processes

(i.e., verbal fluency, semantic abstraction, multitasking) is associated

with accelerated cognitive decline around the same age window in

non-semantic processes (i.e., phonological for language production and

fluid processing for the Cattell task). Overall, this provides empirical

support for the LARA model (Banjac et al., 2021), highlighting the

involvement of executive processes during language production across the

lifespan (Hoyau et al., 2018; Pistono et al., 2021; Shafto & Tyler,

2014). This also reinforces the idea that language is more than just

intra-linguistic processes, and interacts with other cognitive functions

(Hagoort, 2016, 2023).

\*Dedifferentiation-Compensation mechanisms\*

At a cerebral level, our study aligns with previous team work (Roger,

Rodrigues De Almeida, et al., 2022), suggesting language is an

interactive function whose neurocognitive architecture at rest (rs-LANG)

involves an associative (RS NET1), sensorimotor (RS NET2), low-level

attentional (RS NET3), and control-executive (RS NET4) subsystems (see

section 3.1).

Within a lifespan perspective, compositional analysis (section 3.2)

suggests that the cognitive decline observed in non-semantic processes

(i.e., language production and fluid processing) is associated with

reduced local efficiency of rs-LANG (Cao et al., 2014; Chong et al.,

2019; Martin et al., 2022; Song et al., 2014) and reduced segregation in

the control-executive, and sensorimotor subsystems (Dosenbach et al.,

2007; Grady et al., 2016). It highlights that a loss in functional

specialization, or dedifferentiation, drives cognitive decline in

healthy aging adults (Chan et al., 2014, 2017; Deery et al., 2023). In

contrast, enhanced integration of control-executive and sensorimotor

regions within the language connectome may act as a compensatory

mechanism, countering the effects of dedifferentiation (Cabeza et al.,

2018). This compensatory integration is characterized by increased

connector nodes across the lifespan, essential for information transfer

(Bagarinao et al., 2020) and task processing flexibility (Bertolero et

al., 2015). Specifically, connector nodes confer integrative properties

to the network by tuning the connectivity of their neighbors to preserve

modularity or functional specialization (Bertolero et al., 2018), which

leads to better cognitive performances (Meunier et al., 2010),

especially during healthy aging (Meunier et al., 2009; Setton et al.,

2021).

While previous studies focused exclusively on how dedifferentiation

mediates poorer performances in fluid intelligence (Mitchell et al.,

2023\) and long-term memory (Koen et al., 2020), this study aimed to

model the neural mechanisms that bridge dedifferentiation and

compensation (section 3.3), and how the changes in this

dedifferentiation-compensation dynamic relate to the age-related

variability in language abilities discussed previously. Overall, we

suggest that dedifferentiation-compensation follows the principle of the

economy of brain network organization (Bullmore & Sporns, 2012). To

clarify, the reorganization of the language connectome may be governed

by the balance efficiency-cost, which seeks to maximally mitigate

cognitive decline for the minimal integration cost (Barbey, 2018).

Specifically, we identified two compensatory strategies that satisfy

this principle of economy. The first compensatory strategy relies on

acquiring long-distance connections (i.e., inter-modular links) and is

most efficient in younger adulthood thanks to the coupling between DMN

and FPN regions. The second compensatory strategy relies on acquiring

short-distance connections within subsystems and is primarily

implemented in older adulthood.

\*Accelerated cognitive decline emerges from the loss of DMN-FPN

coupling\*

As age increases, we discuss how a change in the

dedifferentiation-compensation dynamic will likely trigger an

acceleration in cognitive decline in non-semantic (e.g., language

production) and synergistic tasks (e.g., verbal fluency).

In younger adults, differentiation is implemented by deactivating

provincial nodes within subsystems, which provide segregative properties

to the network (Bertolero et al., 2015; Guimerà & Amaral, 2005). In

contrast, compensatory integration may be implemented by the synergy

between the DMN and FPN regions. Indeed, DMN regions may deactivate

(i.e., satellite-to-peripheral) to offset the integration cost of

long-distance connections in the FPN regions (i.e.,

provincial-to-connector), thus satisfying the principle of economy. It

aligns with numerous studies indicating that the deactivation of DMN

regions via peripheral hubs (Dohmatob et al., 2020) enhances the

coupling of DMN-FPN (Muller et al., 2016; Pistono et al., 2021).

Interestingly, our results suggest that this DMN-FPN coupling may be

disrupted in older adults due to the increased scarcity of satellite

nodes in the associative subsystem (RS NET1). Indeed, satellite nodes

initiate deactivation in the synergistic strategy (i.e.,

satellite-to-peripheral) and enhanced integration in the other strategy

(i.e., satellite-to-connector). Hence, satellite nodes get more scarce

as age increases in RS NET1. Based on our study, we suggest that this

scarcity could change the way compensatory integration is carried out as

age increases. Indeed, DMN regions may shift their connectivity patterns

from deactivation (i.e., satellite-to-peripheral) to integration (i.e.,

satellite-to-connector), favoring the most direct reconfiguration

mechanism which provides an inexpensive way to mitigate cognitive

decline. Interestingly, control-executive regions in older adults may

also switch to this strategy based on short-distance connections (i.e.,

satellite-to-connector) as inter-modular links are no longer

pre-allocated by DMN regions. Nonetheless, the switch of this strategy

in DMN and FPN regions may be less efficient in mitigating cognitive

decline in the long-term due to the instability of short-distance,

intra-modular connections. This is particularly manifest of a greater

dedifferentiated system in older adults and also aligns with a more

inefficient integration of long-distance connections (i.e.,

provincial-to-satellite instead of provincial-to-connector), further

reducing the mitigating effect of integration.

These findings align with a recent study suggesting that a youth-like

network architecture is associated with more economical processing

(Martin et al., 2022). Therefore, our findings (i) supports that an

efficient reorganization most likely follows the principle of economy of

brain network organization, and also (ii) highlight that satellite nodes

may play a pivotal role in this economical reorganization across the

lifespan, responsible for the shift of connectivity patterns of DMN

regions. This aligns with the DECHA model (Default Executive Coupling

Hypothesis of Aging), which reports that older adults with reduced

deactivation in DMN regions fail to modulate control-executive regions

(Spreng & Turner, 2019; Varangis et al., 2019). This also echoes recent

theoretical (Grasso et al., 2021; Varley et al., 2022) and empirical

studies (Luppi et al., 2022; Santos et al., 2023; Varley et al., 2023)

suggesting that higher-order interactions facilitate higher-level

cognitive performances (Williams et al., 2022) such as cognitive control

(Varley et al., 2023), particularly during healthy aging (Gatica et al.,

2021).

\*A novel integrative and connectomic model: SENECA\*

As Livneh (2023) suggested, we combine the cerebral and cognitive levels

of analysis within a single integrative model: SENECA. The SENECA model

articulates a cerebral (SE) and cognitive (CA) dimension, which embraces

a complex system perspective (NE). We borrow the name from the Seneca

effect, generally found in complex systems, which denotes a slow rise

followed by an abrupt decline (Bardi, 2017). Hereafter, we refer to the

model as SENECA in uppercase and to the Seneca effect in lowercase

letters.

Along the cerebral dimension (SE), we confirm that dedifferentiation and

compensation are two sides of the same coin (Deery et al., 2023; Naik et

al., 2017; Stumme et al., 2020; Tognoli & Kelso, 2014). Specifically, we

show that higher-order interactions between subsystems are the way for

the brain to satisfy the balance between maximal cognitive efficiency

and a minimal cost of integration across the lifespan. In sum, the

synergistic (S) coupling between DMN and FPN regions seems to follow the

principle of the economy (E) of brain network organization (Bullmore &

Sporns, 2012; Martin et al., 2022).

Along the cognitive dimension (CA), we suggest that satellite nodes are

the currency of this economy. Specifically, accelerated cognitive (C)

decline in healthy aging (A) adults may stem from an increased scarcity

of satellite nodes within the language connectome, which disrupts the

way dedifferentiation and compensation are implemented, in turn

disrupting the DMN-FPN coupling that promotes mitigate cognitive decline

mitigation.

Considering both dimensions together, we suggest that the synergistic

\(S\) and economic (E) reorganization of the language connectome produces

a nonlinear (N) and emerging (E) dynamic of cognitive aging (CA). The

'nonlinear' aspect is associated with the acceleration of the cognitive

decline in non-semantic and synergistic tasks, which could mark a

transition in neurocognitive functioning during the fifth decade of

life. The 'emergent' aspect suggests that the reorganization at the

subsystem level induces a dynamic at the system level that is more than

the sum of its parts (Pessoa, 2022; Piccinini, 2022). In line with

Stumme et al. (2022), this makes significant progress toward reconciling

cognitive efficiency across topological levels of analysis.

\*Perspectives and limitations\*

Theoretically, SENECA embraces the notion of cognitomics (Roger et al.,

2018\) which proposes to consider the neuropsychological implications

that the connectomic architecture imposes on human cognition and

behavior. Specifically, we provide evidence that changes in the language

architecture mediates cognitive performances supported by intra-

(language) and extra-linguistic sub-processes (long-term memory,

executive functions), as reported conceptually (Hagoort, 2023; Roger,

Banjac, et al., 2022) and empirically (Roger, Rodrigues De Almeida, et

al., 2022). Within this cognitomic perspective, it seems that the

re-allocation of inter- and intra-modular connections between subsystems

provides an appropriate topological framework to investigate the

cognitive efficiency of compensatory integration across the lifespan. In

further studies, we suggest that this framework could serve as the basis

to examine how the mechanisms underlying this

dedifferentiation-compensation dynamic may differ in clinical

populations.

Our study also shows several methodological novelties. First, we propose

a data-driven pipeline that makes extensive use of compositional data

analysis (Greenacre, 2021; Smith et al., 2016) and demonstrate that

isometric log-ratio transformation (ilr) is a valuable tool to model the

dynamic of network communication within and between subsystems. Second,

the data-driven map presented in Figure 5A supports that simple

bivariate correlations are sufficient to identify the amount of

inter-cognitive synergy as a critical determinant of language function.

The map also provides a latent geometry of age-related language

function, which particularly discriminates between key landmarks of

language processing: sentence comprehension (semantic, low synergy),

language production (phonological, mid-low synergy), and semantic

abstraction (semantic, high synergy). This map suggests that topological

roles (Guimerà & Amaral, 2005) provide a parsimonious framework to track

the mechanisms that implement the inter-cognitive synergy and can also

discriminate between critical language tasks. Therefore, rs-LANG may be

appropriate to investigate the age-related variability in language

abilities, despite being based on a task fMRI atlas (Roger, Rodrigues De

Almeida, et al., 2022).

Our study also shows several limitations. Descriptively, the

probabilistic analysis may only model the most potential topological

role for each region and age group. Therefore, it cannot identify all

the regions involved in the underlying mechanisms and fails to account

for inter-individual variability, especially in older adulthood (Stumme

et al., 2020). To clarify, two individuals may have the exact relative

count of connector nodes, but different regions may implement these

roles. To mitigate this issue, we introduced a tolerance parameter in

our analysis for modeling the trajectories with a probability very close

to the top one. Nonetheless, longitudinal studies would be more

appropriate to investigate the reconfiguration between topological

roles.

We considered GAMs for estimating how the system-level dynamic modulates

the mediation effect of topological changes on age-related cognitive

tasks. Although a direct estimation of nonlinear smooth functions within

an ordinary SEM framework would make the causal model more rigorous,

such a framework has yet to be reported in the literature and is likely

to be computationally challenging. Although cross-sectional data may

also bias estimates in mediation analysis (Cole et al., 2013;

Lindenberger et al., 2011), a recent study comparing longitudinal,

cross-sectional, and cohort effects on cognitive aging revealed that

using cross-sectional data is perfectly reasonable as long as no cohort

effect is assumed (Sørensen et al., 2021). In the present study, no

cohort effect is assumed, given that we estimated universal lifespan

trajectories only. Nonetheless, this opens up future perspectives to

investigate how idiosyncratic mechanisms (Baciu et al., 2021) associated

with a high cognitive reserve (Pitarque et al., 2016; Solé-Padullés et

al., 2009) could provide the basis for a more graceful decline as age

advances. Our findings suggest that subcortical structures such as the

bilateral thalamus and putamen could also play a crucial role in these

mechanisms in late adulthood.

Topologically, current methods in graph theory follow the predicate that

inter-regional interactions of interest are limited to dyadic

relationships: two regions connected by an edge (Battiston et al., 2020,

2021). Therefore, graphs need help to fully account for the topological

characteristics intrinsic to higher-level interactions, which cannot

always be modeled as the sum of dyadic interactions. Although dyadic

patterns can often describe the structural architecture, the functional

dynamics underlying complex cognitive functions such as language are

implemented by a distributed network of cortico-subcortical regions and

their multilevel interactions (Gazzaniga et al., 2019; Giusti et al.,

2016\) suggesting higher-order coupling. In addition, several studies

have highlighted the redundant nature of specific higher-order motifs

(Merchan & Nemenman, 2016), which can sometimes be fully described in

dyadic relationships. Therefore, modeling higher-level interactions has

a robust statistical (Schneidman et al., 2006; Yu et al., 2011),

topological (Gardner et al., 2021; Giusti et al., 2015), and theoretical

justification for quantifying how the synergy-redundancy balance evolves

across the lifespan to mitigate cognitive decline (Gatica et al., 2021;

Luppi et al., 2022, 2023; Stanford et al., 2022).

Considering the breadth of current neuroimaging datasets, the use of

sophisticated techniques designed to yield high inter- and low

intra-individual variability is timely. The proportional thresholding

for the topological structure (Jiang et al., 2023) may lead to the

exclusion of weaker edges that are neurobiologically meaningful (van

den Heuvel et al., 2017). Therefore, assessing how a data-driven

topological filtering scheme such as OMST (Orthogonal Minimum Spanning

Tree; Dimitriadis et al., 2017; Martin et al., 2022) compares to

proportional thresholding would provide new insight into how older

adults navigate the trade-off between cognitive efficiency and the cost

of synergistic reorganization.

\# Conclusion

Language is an interactive function that embodies the complexity of

human cognition. In this study, we aimed to clarify how language

function is implemented at the cerebral level across an individual's

lifespan. We found that synergistic coupling between DMN and FPN regions

may be the way for the brain to maximally mitigate cognitive decline in

language production and verbal fluency while limiting the reorganization

cost. Relatedly, a disruption of this coupling could mark a transition

in neurocognitive functioning towards less synergistic processing around

the fifth decade of life. We summarize these findings in a novel

integrative and connectomic model called SENECA, which articulates a

cerebral (S- synergistic E- economical) and cognitive (C- cognitive A-

aging) dimension within a complex systems perspective (N- nonlinear E-

emergent).
